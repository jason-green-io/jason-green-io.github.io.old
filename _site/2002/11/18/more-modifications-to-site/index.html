    <p>More modifications to the site, I put Arial everywhere.. kinda like it. Nic suggested I put the background static, adds a nice little touch. I added the title, and section.. some people must be reading this and wonder what I’m talking about. .. hah.. oh well. Congratulations Nic! He’s getting married! woo! FOr the past month I’ve been buying cases of V8 juice.. I like V8 juice.. did you know it’s 2 servings of vegetables? or so they say. tssssst… ahhhh… gulp.. ow. “This one time, at band camp…” I love that line near the end of American Pie 2. m.i.l.f. m.i.l.f. m.i.l.f. m.i.l.f.</p>

<p>Mike: So how long do I wait to call?
Trent: A day.
Mike: Tomorrow.
Sue: Tomorrow, then a day.
Trent: Yeah.
Mike: So two days?
Trent: Yeah, I guess you could call it that, two days.
Sue: Definitely, two days is like industry standard.
Trent: You know I used to wait two days to call anybody, but now it’s like everyone in town waits two days. So I think three days is kind of money. What do you think?
Sue: Yeah, but two’s enough not to look anxious.
Trent: But I think three days is kind of money. You know because you…
Mike: Yeah, but you know what, mabey I’ll wait 3 weeks. How’s that? And tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and I just happened to run into her number.
Charles: Then ask her where you met her.
Mike: Yeah, I’ll ask her where I met her. I don’t remember. What does she look like? And then I’ll asked if we fucked. Is that… would that be… T, would that be the money?
Trent: You know what. Ha ha ha Mike, laugh all you want but if you call too soon you might scare off a nice baby who’s ready to party.
Mike: Well how long are you guys gonna wait to call your babies?
Trent, Sue: Six days.</p>
