<p>Bought a 100mb US roaming plan for 50$. What a rip off. I hate you Rogers, no, you know what, it&rsquo;s rogers, you don&rsquo;t deserve my capital letters.</p>

<p>Update: @roammobility enlightened me on their service, I could be paying 90% less for my data. As I type this. Fuck you rogers!</p>
