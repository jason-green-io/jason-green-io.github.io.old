<p>Often when I order from Tim Horton&rsquo;s in the morning, I will try to order a Sausage and Biscuit combo. This comes with a beverage, a hash brown potato thingy and a biscuit with a sausage patty and cheese in the middle. For a reason unknown to me, no matter how clear I make it, no matter if I order EXACTLY from the menu, and explicitly request &ldquo;no egg&rdquo;, they add egg. This turns the Sausage and Biscuit into a Breakfast Sandwich. They are separate entities.. they are different on the menu.. they have their own separate picture. It drives me insane!</p>

<p>McDonald&rsquo;s does the same thing with their Sausage McMuffin.. I somehow end up with an Egg McMuffin.</p>

<p>It really ruins a morning when we&rsquo;re venturing out on a long trip, we stop by a McD&rsquo;s or Timmie&rsquo;s, get a coffee to shake out the cobwebs, order a greasy breakfast, get back on the highway and realize I got egg. (I dont like eggs, get over it)</p>
