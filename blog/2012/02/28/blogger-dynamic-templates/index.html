<p>Looks like they kinda work with iOS now. I disabled the mobile template, now Safari loads a mobile version of the dynamic view. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s better than nothing.</p>

<p>Update: back to regular old templates, dynamic is not ready for prime time, like most of google&rsquo;s stuff</p>
