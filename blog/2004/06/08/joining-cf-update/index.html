<p>I gave my application to a recruiting officer Monday, I was missing a few things, so I had to fill out a few more forms and get transcripts for my college marks. If all ends are tied (missing stuff faxed to Fredericton) by Friday, there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;d start my testing and medical stuff the 23-24. Once that&rsquo;s done, I wait for a conditional offer.</p>

<p>Other than that, I&rsquo;ve been doing some hockey watching, lots of drinking, some frisbee playing, movie watching, got a wisdom tooth pulled, eye exam .. that&rsquo;s pretty much covers it.</p>
