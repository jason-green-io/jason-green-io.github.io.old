<p>So I talked to my friendly neighborhood recruiter, and he says I&rsquo;m set to do all the testing stuff on Wednesday .. that means physical fitness test, aptitude test, medical examination and interview. If I complete all 4 successfully, that means I&rsquo;ll be offered a position with the Canadian Forces. So that&rsquo;s the news .. what&rsquo;s new with you?</p>
