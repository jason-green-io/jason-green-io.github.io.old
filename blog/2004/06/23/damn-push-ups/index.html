<p>This is what I hear and how my testing went.</p>

<p>Next time the trade MIGHT open up is in September, if I&rsquo;m moderately high on the waiting list, there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;ll get offered a job .. unless they decide to cut back on recruiting in that trade .. there would have been a chance to send my file for selection tomorrow, they have opennings for the trade right now, but because my file is brand new, and there&rsquo;s alot of stuff left to do with it, there was no way to make it in time, so I&rsquo;m aiming for September .. barring unforseen difficulties, my file should be ready way before then. I passed everything except one of the parts of the physical fitness test, the push-ups .. needed to do 19 in a row, was only able to do 14 .. so I need to practice and retry. I can reschedule anytime, meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll be doing alot of push ups in my spare time.</p>

<p>So all is left is a second try of the PT test and then wait till September. I was told my results on the aptitude test do allow me to apply for the ATIS Tech trade .. which is one of the hardest to get into. Damn I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>
