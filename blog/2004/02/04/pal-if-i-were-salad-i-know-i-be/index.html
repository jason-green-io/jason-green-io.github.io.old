<p>Time for an update, I&rsquo;ve been neglecting this place, even if I have plenty of time to update. There isn&rsquo;t much new, Joker moved in with me .. I&rsquo;m still single .. I still work at the same place .. I still don&rsquo;t know anything about the job .. borrrring.</p>

<p>I bought Sopranos season 4, watch it, can&rsquo;t wait for season 5 to start. Other shows I&rsquo;m watching:</p>

<p>Went to Cosmo/Oxygen with Monique Saturday, holy crap we had fun! I talked like I was schoolgirl .. and danced like I was a schoolgirl.</p>

<p>Superbowl night with Nic, Gary and Brad .. and Doris the Keg. Great time, good food, good beer, borg boob.</p>
