<p>A joke I lol&#8217;ed at.</p>

<p><em>I was walking across a bridge one day, and I saw a man standing on the edge, about to jump off. So I ran over and said &ldquo;Stop! don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he said. I said, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s so much to live for!&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well&hellip; are you religious or atheist?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Religious.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Me too! Are you Christian or Buddhist?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Christian.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Me too! Are you Catholic or Protestant?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Protestant.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Me too! Are you Episcopalian or Baptist?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Baptist!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Wow! Me too! Are you Baptist Church of God or Baptist Church of the Lord?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Baptist Church of God!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Me too! Are you original Baptist Church of God, or are you reformed Baptist Church of God?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Reformed Baptist Church of God!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Me too! Are you Reformed Baptist Church of God, reformation of 1879, or Reformed Baptist Church of God, reformation of 1915?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Reformed Baptist Church of God, reformation of 1915!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Die, heretic scum&rdquo;, and pushed him off.</em></p>
