<p>Holy crap I&rsquo;m messed up in my weekends.. I thought this was Monique weekend.. but duh.. it&rsquo;s valentines day (yuk). 2 weeks.. that&rsquo;s a long time to wait.</p>

<p>Friken valentine&rsquo;s day. I don&rsquo;t capitalize it, because I don&rsquo;t like it one bit. I don&rsquo;t even know if it needs to be capitalized, if it does.. then screw you valentine&rsquo;s day!</p>

<p>Remi logged on MSN today, talked to him for a bit, it had been a while. Damn I&rsquo;d like to go visit.</p>

<p>Well, now that I&rsquo;m free Saturday, what to do what to do. I know there will be alcohol involved, to both celebrate AND .. um .. not celebrate.</p>

<p>I feel like going into one of those &ldquo;type just for the hell of it&rdquo; kind of rants, like I used to do. There only one problem, I&rsquo;m asking myself the same question I always ask in this situation: what to type? I could talk about the white B-691 Hi-Fi Sound Monitor speakers that are directly in front of me, but that&rsquo;s not interesting, at all, nope. How about I talk about how there&rsquo;s 202 jobs in the queue waiting to be printed.. I just need to wait for those E0B2Q jobs to finish so I can fianlly switch 9004 to bkhol and get rid of a big chunk of those jobs. Naaa.. again, not very interesting.. even for people who know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Work talk is boring, and generally bad. I hate work talk, specially call center work talk. &ldquo;I had this one person who kept yelling at me and blah blah blah&rdquo; I understand it&rsquo;s necessary to let it all out so as to relieve stress and such, but please, don&rsquo;t talk to me about it. I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of calls from hell, I think I can honestly say I&rsquo;ve heard it all. I&rsquo;d rather not hear it again, it just brings back memories that I&rsquo;ve subconciously selectively repressed. Hooo look at that queue go down .. sorry .. work talk.</p>

<p>I missed Friends, Survivor and The Apprentice tonight, I&rsquo;ll start downloading them as soon as I get home, hopfully they&rsquo;ll finish by the time I wake up. I watched American Idol on Friday and Monady I think.. I kinda got interested.. but I&rsquo;m not downloading the ones I&rsquo;m missing.. dunno why, I don&rsquo;t care much I guess. I desperately need a haircut, and I need to get my car looked at, I think I&rsquo;ll stay up today and take a nap this afternoon. I also need to do laundry, geez, so much to do.</p>
