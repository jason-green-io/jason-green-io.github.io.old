<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing alot of blog reading tonight, thought I&rsquo;d post for good measure. Kinda like karma, ya know.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m at work, babysitting printers, that&rsquo;s what I do on night shift, I babysit printers&hellip;. OMG LOL &ldquo;my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard&rdquo; .. on the radio .. hoo, okay, calm toi la. Nope can&rsquo;t resist, &ldquo;j&#8217;ai d&#8217;quoi dans mes shorts&rdquo;, hah.. okay.. as I was saying, right, I babysit printers. THey blink when they need to be fed (paper), they blink when they puke (paperjams), they need to be burbed when they&rsquo;re full (too many pages in the outbut bin). I hate this job.</p>

<p>My iPod battery died about 2 hours ago, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m listening to the radio .. actually not at this precise moment, the volume is turned down so I can hear the repetetive sounds of 5 printers printing in unison. I&rsquo;m going mad.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for Saturday, going out with Moe, we&rsquo;re going to paint the town .. some color that will represent our drunken state. I&rsquo;m also looking forward to spending time with Gary before I go out dancing (if you call my body movements dancing).</p>

<p>I bought an <a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight</a> (damn, I said that already), really cool, I&rsquo;m never calling Gary on a conventional phone again. It so fun! Hihi!</p>

<p>I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a>, like Nic says, it doesn&rsquo;t have much dialogue, but it makes up for it in the visuals and the acting. It reminded me of American Beatuy, how silent moments can convey so much.</p>

<p>Oh, and I found my flashlight (for those who didn&rsquo;t know, I had lost my flashlight)</p>
