<p>Damn, right now, Toxic is playing on my internet radio station. I just got back from cosmo, good time, actually, I had a really good time, I talked to Ian alot, about his future plans and Family Guy :) I helped 4 cute girls from St John get a cab. They were really greattful.. they were a bunch of cool people.</p>

<p>Geez, I don&rsquo;t want to get anybody jealous.. if I did, I want to know right away, I&rsquo;m not used to posting stuff like this on my blog.. frig. Tonight started with supper from St. Hubert, take out style. Kristy, Isabelle, Al and I went to St Hubert to eat. Line was too long, so we decided to take take-out. Ate at my place.. then we played Monopoly, Kristy and Isabelle kicked our asses. Isabelle was the clear winner after Kristy forfeited :)</p>

<p>..</p>

<p>Then we played 200. I lost, as usual.. frig, now I need to get into the whole &ldquo;200 losing streak thing&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d rather not, but here it goes: during the past 3 weeks, Al and I have been partners playing card vs. Kristy and Isabelle. We&rsquo;ve lost both times&hellip; by.. alot. This time, teams were changed, Kristy and I vs. Al and Isabelle. I still lost, but by a smaller margin.. I&rsquo;m thinking I suck. No one wants to admit it, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m the root cause of my losing streak.</p>

<p>What else is new.. nothing except I got my kilt. Yes, a kilt. My utilikilt has arrived, I wear it anytime I can .. it&rsquo;s so comfy, it&rsquo;s hard to put on jeans now. I don&rsquo;t understand why it&rsquo;s socially acceptable for women to wear a skirt and men can only wear pants.. there are fundamental appendages that should automatically qualify us to wear an un-bifurcated garment. Damn you acceptable social behaviors and related clothing styles.</p>

<p>I digress.</p>

<p>Blah.</p>

<p>Damn I need to go to bed in case I&rsquo;m called to go to breakfast tomorrow. Oh, something else going on tomorrow.. SKating with Monique&hellip; and the long awaited drink/dancefest. Geez, tcheu journ√©e.</p>

<p>Oh&hellip; dance version of Toxic .. I&rsquo;ll be hearing that alot in the future :D.</p>
