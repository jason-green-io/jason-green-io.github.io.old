<p>Blogging on the road, Ned and I are currently just outside of Levis QC, we&rsquo;re heading into what seems like a thunderstorm, w00t! It&rsquo;s a big one, one bolt every few seconds. The weather on the way up was really nice, when we hit Rivi√®re du Loup it kinda got warm and muggy .. that&rsquo;s probally why there&rsquo;s a thunderstorm .. d&#8217;oh, we&rsquo;re not going in it, oh well, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be more on the way. Montreal is 235 KM away. Oh wait, scratch that, we will be going into one of them, seems there&rsquo;s a alot of them. Woohoo, lots of rain and lightning and stuff!</p>
