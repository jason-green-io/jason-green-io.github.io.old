<p>Listening to Rhiannon, watched the Mets game tonight, was a good game till Moncton lost. Turns out Ned was doing titles, pretty damn cool. Tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to 5 Islands in NS with the family, should be fun. Al moved out, I&rsquo;m alone for September then I move in with Kingpat and M@t, that&rsquo;s going to be a blast .. I&rsquo;m not a gamer now, but living with Mat will surely convert me .. he&rsquo;s hardcore.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing nothing these days, staying inside, watching TV. One day Ned and I played frisbee .. oh, and there was the Colt 45 party with Yves, that was fun .. and the Monoxides concert .. I think my hearing is forever depleted since that night.</p>
