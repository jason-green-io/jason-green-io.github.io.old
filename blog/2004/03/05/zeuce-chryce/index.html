<p>First picker goes down due to hard drive problems, then there&rsquo;s the latest developments in my soap opera life .. now my iBook is dying due to hard drive problems. I&rsquo;m not upset or anything .. but it&rsquo;s a little unpleasant.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about picker, people hardly used it. I&rsquo;m not rushed to fix it, but I do want to fix it. My soap opera .. it&rsquo;s nice to be in one instead of watching for a change. Que sera, sera. I&rsquo;m brining my iBook in as soon as I&rsquo;m positive I have all my stuff backed up, or that it dies completely.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, it&rsquo;s official, I&rsquo;m never using IE again. Unless I need it at work to visit a crappy Microsoft biased site.</p>
