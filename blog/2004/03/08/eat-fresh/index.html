<p>I&rsquo;m going to spend the last hour of work I have typing here.</p>

<p>Tonight I&rsquo;d like to go to Doc&rsquo;s for jam night, haven&rsquo;t been there in a couple weeks. I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m going to call someone whom I&rsquo;m supposed to call to do something ;) Chris&#8217; gf/fiance is in Moncton, I&rsquo;m hoping he&rsquo;ll bring her there so I can meet her, if he&rsquo;s playing. I&rsquo;m also hoping <a href="http://www.colepaugh.com/">Colepaugh</a> will be there. It doesn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s playing anywere, &lsquo;cept South By SouthWest next week. I&rsquo;m almost done reading The Demon-Haunted World .. next up will be something by David Suzuki.</p>

<p>My title is reference to the almost empty 21 oz. cup I have sitting on the desk. It used to filled up, brimming with Mountain Dew. Alas, I drank it all. I had a chicken sub garnished with green peppers, pickles and cucumbers .. a little mayo .. salt and pepper. It was pretty good .. for a sub. SubWay on Main St. is open 24hrs .. that&rsquo;s great when you work crazy ass shifts like 19:30-7:30.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m listening to ABBA .. hehe, just for fun, I wanted to know how many times I&rsquo;ve mentioned ABBA in my blog .. 3 times .. I think that&rsquo;s 3 times too many for alot of you.. well, 4 now. There&rsquo;s something about that music that I like.. my Mom used to listen to ABBA when I was young, and in the womb, I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s imprinted on my neural pathways.</p>

<p>Speaking of music, I need to get more jazz. a few months back I watched The Comedian .. it&rsquo;s basically Jerry Seinfeld trying to become a stand-up comedian again, anyway, the soundtrack is great, full of jazz. I&rsquo;ve got most of the songs from it, including one of my new favorite tunes.. Waters of March sung by Suzannah McCorkle. I could listen to that song and her voice forever.</p>

<p>Which reminds me..</p>

<p>I lost all my tunes .. and all my old emails .. and other things I&rsquo;ll eventually find out about. I got some stuff off the HD before it died .. but not my Library folder .. the one folder that&rsquo;s really important. I&rsquo;ve got pictures and documents and stuff.. so ALL is not lost.. but alot is. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can get the dead drive spinning again.. at least long enough to get data off of it. I&rsquo;ll be bringing it in in a couple hours, for the third time. It pains me to say it, but I&rsquo;ve brought an Apple product in 3 times to get fixed, hasn&rsquo;t cost me a thing, but it&rsquo;s an inconvenience for sure. My next laptop is going to be a tank, a 12&#8221; PowerBook G4.</p>

<p>Still 30 minutes left, and I&rsquo;ve run out of things to say, as usual. Ohhhh.. a song I haven&rsquo;t heard in a while .. The Bad Touch .. see <a href="http://greener.sdf1.org/blog/archives/000206.html">this</a> entry for the lyrics. Here&rsquo;s an idea.. I&rsquo;ll post a picture of something..</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve had this site for 4 years .. and this is the first time I post a picture of a monkey. Wow.</p>
