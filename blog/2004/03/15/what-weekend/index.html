<p>Friday:</p>

<p>Woke up to the sound of the buzzer around 18:00. Nic came by to start off our night of heavy drinking. So I got ready and off to Pump House we go. Our first table was not &ldquo;boot worthy&rdquo;, way too high. We settled for a normal table where we could drink our boots in comfort. We both ordered a boot. Both blueberry, his had blueberries, mine did not. They&rsquo;re not allowed to give 2 boots to one table, because they only have 2 boots. We both got a boot, without getting 2 separate tables. ~2 hours later, we have a VERY good buzz. We headed over to my place to settle down a bit; watched the latest Survivor. On to .. another bar to drink .. we diecided on VooDoo. Get there, pretty much dead, but people slowly showed up. We had a few martinis and a few other drinks. (I lost count after a while). Monique joined us later on, yay, I had a dancing partner. After VooDoo we went on to Big Stop. I ordered a Day&#8217;n&#8217;Ross, but barely ate it. Got back, stayed up, don&rsquo;t remember what I did. Slept on and off till 19:30.</p>

<p>Saturday:</p>

<p>Woke up, ate the Day&#8217;n&#8217;Ross. Went back to bed. Woke up, drank water, went back to bed. This went a a few more times. Finally got out of bed around 20:00, got ready to go to O2 .. on a mission. Mission failed. Had a shot with Lynie, the high point of the night :) Went home early, got Smart Pizza. Went to bed at 3:00.</p>

<p>Sunday:</p>

<p>Pretty much slept thru Sunday. Woke up here and there and watched TV shows I downloaded. Sunday was &ldquo;lethargic day&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Present:</p>

<p>Woke up at 1:00. At work, the coffee I had with breakfast at Jean&rsquo;s with Al is wearing off, I&rsquo;m going to need a Tim&rsquo;s soon. Plan for tonight is Doc&rsquo;s with Gary and Al. I&rsquo;m going to be tired, high on caffeine .. the alcohol is going to have quite an effect. I just hope Gary doesn&rsquo;t coax me into getting the same number of pitchers as the last time we went to Doc&rsquo;s. Ouff. Btw, this post has comments enabled. Post away. Not all the templates are updated, so stuff might not look very nice. I&rsquo;m working on it.</p>
