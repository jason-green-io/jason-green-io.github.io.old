<p>I&rsquo;m finally recuperated. Al actually had to fill me in on details over lunch today, I don&rsquo;t think I was ever that drunk. I was prettyyy prettyyy prettyyy prettyyyy pretty, prettyy pretty drunk.</p>

<p>I really need to do groceries, I&rsquo;ve got a list and everything. I said it before, I need to get the car checked .. still haven&rsquo;t done that.</p>

<p>Curb Your Enthusiasm concluded it&rsquo;s 4th season, it actually ended on a high note, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that.</p>
