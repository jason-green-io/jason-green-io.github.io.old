<p>What a day/morning. Yesterday was a fun day at work, talked to Peter Shearer about the MP3 players, the Beach Boys, the history of the Blue Cross building and power distribution units.. don&rsquo;t ask. After work, I parcticed a little bit of Soul Calibur 2.. I always use Taki, when Al got home, I played against him, he won 3 games to 2.. not too bad for someone who doesn&rsquo;t play regularly .. apparently I&rsquo;m getting better.</p>

<p>Then it was cards at Gary&rsquo;s, what can I say, any time Gary and I drink, we always have a whole lot of fun.. it was Al, Leo, Gary and I, we learned how to play 45 and then we played 200, Leo and I never won one game.. I blame it on myself.. I wasn&rsquo;t really trying to win.. I was trying to have fun.. which I did. When Al and Leo left, Gary got out his guitar and we sang from the magical book of songs.. like an old fasioned karaoke .. then we played songs from his playlist and sang along like and old fasioned karaoke .. then he played karaoke files .. like .. actual karaoke. We had ALOT of fun doing that.. but unfortunately, we irritated Gary&rsquo;s 31 week pregnant wife .. I felt REALLY bad. I hope I can make it up to her somehow .. I WILL figure something out.</p>

<p>I walked home, for exercise, picked up a 6 inch pizziola sub from .. Subway .. duh. And now im listening to my &ldquo;wayback&rdquo; playlist.. I should have brought my iPod to Gary&rsquo;s, it would have made a much more interesting walk home. LOL .. Red Red Wine, we sang that.. good times!</p>

<p>Red, red wine
Goes to my head
Makes me forget that I
Still need you so
Red, red wine
It<code>s up to you
All I can do, I</code>ve done
memories won<code>t go
memories won</code>t go
I have sworn everytime
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong now I find
Just one thing makes me forget
Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don<code>t let me be alone
It</code>s tearin<code>apart
My blue, blue heart
I have sworn everytime
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong now I find
Just one thing makes me forget
Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearin' apart
My blue, blue heart
