<p>Check this out, a second post in the same day. That hasn&rsquo;t happened in a long time. I kept working on the site this morning (8:00), added the colors and borders and stuff. I really like CSS.</p>

<p>Monique just called, it&rsquo;s a go for tonight, w00t! Going to have supper then .. drinking. When Ned comes down, he likes going to restaurants he doesn&rsquo;t have in Woodstock, mainly, BJ&rsquo;s and Sun Sun. Mmmmm.</p>

<p>I moved my phone charger to my room, since it makes more sense to have it there, when I go to bed, I can let it charge, and if it rings, I&rsquo;m right there, otherwise, it&rsquo;ll be in my pocket, fully charged, because the charger is in my room. .. so, yeah .. my phone charger.</p>

<p>I love the part of Live and Let Die by Paul McCartney when it picks up, then goes into some reggae, then back to the intense James Bond action scene score.</p>
