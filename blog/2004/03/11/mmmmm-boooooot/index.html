<p>Tomorrow night Nic and I are going out drinking. He says he&rsquo;ll be starting off with a boot, looks like I&rsquo;m going to have to do the same. Blueberry, hold the blueberries, thanks.</p>

<p>My laptop is still in the shop, I&rsquo;ve been living off of Al&rsquo;s laptop, using pine on sdf for my mail and the official MSN client on Durandal (Al&rsquo;s powerbook G4) since he uses aMSN, both can run at the same time. I&rsquo;ve been doing ALL my surfing at work. I&rsquo;m pissed that I lost all my old emails .. I had some stuff in there I REALLY wanted to save. Ah well, what am I supposed to do. Faget-a-abat-it. (I watched Donnie Brasco yesterday).</p>

<p>I should be getting paid in 5 hours. Supposed to be the 15th, but since it&rsquo;s a Monday, they have to deposit the money early .. that&rsquo;s how it is with me .. not the case for some co-workers. I better get paid, I need to get the car checked, it&rsquo;s been making noises, I think the distributor is messed up.</p>

<p>Got the new Resurgo today, interesting stuff will be upgraded this summer, such as Centennial Park, Victoria Park .. Vaughan Harvey extention the the bridge .. Assomption phase 2 (adding 3-4 more side streets south of Main St. and more park area and flowers and residential areas and stuff) and of course the Riverfront Park boardwalk phase 5.</p>
