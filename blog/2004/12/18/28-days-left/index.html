<p>I&rsquo;m leaving in 28 days. w00t.</p>

<p>Damn, I&rsquo;d kill for a large new mozzy right now. Maybe I&rsquo;ll go to Big Stop later. I&rsquo;ve got a Costco pizza in the freezer, maybe I&rsquo;ll cook that. Maybe I&rsquo;ll eat out.. I dunno, I haven&rsquo;t had Arby&rsquo;s in a while. I wont be eating McDonalds though. I hate that place now. (Even though I did eat there a few days after watching Super Size Me, I&rsquo;m such a hypocrite.)</p>

<p>Saw JSB and Slowcoaster Friday with Al and Bob. Great show. Nothing planned for this weekend, like most weekends, I&rsquo;ll take it easy and not do anything. Or do nothing. Either one really.</p>
