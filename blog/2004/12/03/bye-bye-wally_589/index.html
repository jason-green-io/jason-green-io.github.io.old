<p>I have just been informed that Wally&rsquo;s Red and White Canteen, the best take out restaurant in Woodstock NB, is closing its red door December 18th. That day will be a sad day in this man&rsquo;s and many others&#8217; lives.</p>

<p>I invite everyone to join the guys in Woodstock on December 18th in Woodstock to bid a fond farewell to one of New-Brunswick&rsquo;s premiere food establishments and toast one of its foremost entrepreneurs.</p>
