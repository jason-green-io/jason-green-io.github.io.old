<p>Tonight started off as a normal &ldquo;I want to go downtown because I haven&rsquo;t been in such a long time&rdquo; kind of night. So I drove all the way down Elmwood, onto Donald, down Church and parked in front of St. James Gate. Mullet Monday&rsquo;s .. it&rsquo;s been a staple in my life ever since Monday&rsquo;s at Doc&rsquo;s died. Sadly, Paramount was closed.. no mullets. So, for a split second I decided to go to Doc&rsquo;s .. because it&rsquo;s Monday.. but wait.. Monday&rsquo;s at Doc&rsquo;s is dead.. so I go to St. James Gate.. the new home of Rik and Brendan. Walk in, greeted by a familiar face, Wayne. &ldquo;Hey, how&rsquo;s it goin&#8217;, gimme a Guiness.&rdquo; At this point I&rsquo;m not too happy about the whole no mullets thing. Moe&rsquo;s the drummer.. alright.. this is cool, Rik is there.. so is Brendan .. alright this is shaping up to be a good night.. Chris!!! woohoo Chris is here!!! They start with a Neil Young tune.. Brendan can&rsquo;t sing.. what? throat surgury.. that&rsquo;s too bad.. so who picks up the slack? Chris.. woohoo. the next 7 songs are all Beatles. wow.. just .. wow. I got to watch Chris sing Here Comes The Sun, Norwegian Wood, and A Day In The Life .. probably more. Ch&#8217;te dit, pas mal cool. Talked to Moe (Mau-rice) and Chris, he explained what he&rsquo;s aiming for with all the acoustic shows he&rsquo;s been doing lately .. go-go gadget Neil Young. Tonight&rsquo;s expectations were blown away. Still wondering why Paramount was closed.</p>
