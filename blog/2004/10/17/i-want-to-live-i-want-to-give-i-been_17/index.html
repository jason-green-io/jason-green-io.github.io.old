<p>It has been one week and one day since my last entry. Highlights of my week include:</p>

<p>  *</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Johnny Talk-Talk
*</p></li>
<li><p>hiking a section of the Dobson with new friend Renée. We discovered an old secion of the trail that was blocked off because of presumably flooding.. walked it anyway. On our way back we met up with two (I think) barred owls. Quite a sight.
*</p></li>
<li><p>bowling with Eric, Shelley and Ned, scored a measly 140 something.
*</p></li>
<li><p>Barnyard and drunken golf/Halo/card playing with the boys.
*</p></li>
<li><p>Halifax with Renée, her sister and sister&rsquo;s husband, IMAX Harry Potter, supper at Il Mercato Ritorante and stimulating conversation all the way back to Shediac Bridge.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s hard to top these days, may next week be as fulfilling.</p>
