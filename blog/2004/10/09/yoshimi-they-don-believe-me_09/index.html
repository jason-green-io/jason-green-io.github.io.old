<p>It&rsquo;s a relaxed Saturday afternoon here in Irishtown. I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll be seeing Team America tonight.. then head to the Player&rsquo;s Lounge and see Doyle work his magic. Freddy Al is supposed to come down for that, I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ll see him there.. wasn&rsquo;t able to coordinate with him cuz he hasn&rsquo;t been online all day. I&rsquo;m eagerly waiting for Enterprise episode 1 season 4 to finish. Last season finished with a twisted cliffhanger.</p>

<p>Here are pictures of my new room:</p>
