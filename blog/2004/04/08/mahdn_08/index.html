<p>While I was on my way to work I met Martin in the atrium. I hadn&rsquo;t talked to him in quite a while, looks like we&rsquo;re going sea kayaking in 2 weeks. I&rsquo;m bidding on a bluetooth module for my phone, finally. Prices on those are low now, since the phone is soo old. I&rsquo;ll be able to update my blog in very unlikely places .. I&rsquo;ll also be able to transfer phone numbers to and from my phone .. very important since I don&rsquo;t have a backup of numbers on my phone.</p>
