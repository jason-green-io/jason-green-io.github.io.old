<p>I said I&rsquo;d take a picture of a spectacular sunrise, so I took a picture of a spectacular sunrise. That was this morning.</p>

<p>Coming out of the elevator I saw Anise, I&rsquo;ve been saying hi to her since grade 5. I remember bugging the hell out her at Abbey-Landry, I&rsquo;d say hi, then she&rsquo;d say hi back, then I&rsquo;d say hi again .. and on and on. Those were the days.</p>
