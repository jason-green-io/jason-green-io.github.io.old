<p>I start my &ldquo;extended vacation&rdquo; June 11th. I got laid off. I saw it coming a mile away, not surprised. Soooo.. Ned, that means we&rsquo;re going to Calgary .. Al if you want to come .. book vacation anytime after June 11th.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t post yesterday because I didn&rsquo;t feel like it.. but there&rsquo;s plenty to say. Nic and I went to Paramount .. Mullet Monday&rsquo;s. Of course we drank .. alot. I didn&rsquo;t get kicked out though! I made a point to tell the bartender, who was there as a patron, that I was walking out on my on own volition :) We try to go to the mystic after-hours bar that is always closed after-hours. Walk there .. it&rsquo;s closed. So we pick up some food at Subway on Main after we were professionally told by the night manager (imagine the Simpsons fast food teenage nerd guy) that they don&rsquo;t serve &ldquo;walkers&rdquo;. Walk to another after-hours bar we think is open .. Miss Behaven .. also closed, so we take a cab home. I get to my place .. no keys. Locked out. Back to Subway for coffee, guy says I got Bawls if you want some .. he bought a case of the stuff .. ohhh sweeeet. So I buy some Bawls from him. I go to work .. at 5:30, working at 8:30. Talked to Luc for a bit then slept on the couch till 8:00. My boss Michael pulls me in the office and tells me the news and says I can go home. Laid off. No keys. Locked out. I keep working, Joker gets home around 2:30. I go home. At that point I had had 2 hours of sleep in 30 hours. Went to bed.</p>

<p>Slept 12 hours which brings me here, and Proteus is still not out!!!!!!!!!!!! I didn&rsquo;t post yesterday, first day I skip I think. I theoritically could make 86 posts, but I was looking at the posts I made 4 years ago .. some are just one line .. that&rsquo;s not fair, I don&rsquo;t post tiny posts like that as often as I used to. So I think I&rsquo;m changing the rules to my own contest (because I&rsquo;m judge number 1 of 1 on the panel, and I lead the board of directors). Instead of posting 86, I&rsquo;ll post as least once per day. Let me know if this is acceptable.</p>
