<p>Mouhouhahahaha!!! I skipped another day! Nic and I went geocaching yesterday .. out of 4 caches we found 0. I think most of them were out of season. We got to a very cool one in Freddy, on the north side, some kind of volcano thing full of pine trees, pretty cool.</p>

<p>I started playing Tetris again, I beat my high score. 301306 starting off on level 9. This is with Tetris DX. I also uninstalled the POT for my afterburner and resoldered a few connections that looked crappy .. some still look crappy, but it works.</p>

<p>Very nice day today.. it a &ldquo;beer on Main street&rdquo; kind of day.</p>
