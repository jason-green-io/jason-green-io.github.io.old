<p>Another lack of updates. No, I&rsquo;m not skipping work .. I wish I could .. soon I won&rsquo;t have to. I booked the vacation I&rsquo;ve accumulated during the year and will use it prior to June 11, which brings my last day to May 28.</p>

<p>Aliant is on strike .. doesn&rsquo;t affect me one bit. Yay for them.</p>

<p>I start 2 weeks of nights on Tuesday at midnight. I&rsquo;m going to enjoy my weekend. I applied for the Air Force thru the website, now I&rsquo;m waiting for a call from the recruiters. I can&rsquo;t wait to get the ball rolling on this.</p>
