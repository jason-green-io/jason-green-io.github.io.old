<p>PODs I like to call them .. no, I don&rsquo;t really call them that, I didn&rsquo;t even make up the acronym, just so happens it fits .. &ldquo;POD&rdquo;. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve got alot of my stuff in these container things .. memories from MM, pictures, souvenirs comic books and camping equipment. They rock, I remember a time when I didn&rsquo;t have them, I had drawers filled to the brim with crap, I couldn&rsquo;t find anything .. now I&rsquo;ve got plastic thingies that are filled to the brim, but transparent, and I still can&rsquo;t find anything. I need to buy more, I&rsquo;ve got more crap that needs to be &ldquo;organized&rdquo;.</p>
