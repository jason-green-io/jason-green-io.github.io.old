<p>I hate the bell, it rings all the time, it&rsquo;s ringing now .. it rings when I don&rsquo;t want it to ring. It wakes me up, all the time. Why must churches ring bells? I can understand. 100 years ago, it was to let everyone know that congregation was ending, or starting .. but that was before digital watches, the printing press (for posting times and schedules) and the internet. Ding ding ding my ass.</p>
