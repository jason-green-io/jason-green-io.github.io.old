<p>Crack that whip
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
Break your momma&rsquo;s back</p>

<p>When a problem comes along
You must whip it
Before the cream sits out too long
You must whip it
When something&rsquo;s going wrong
You must whip it</p>

<p>now whip it
into shape
shape it up
get straight
go forward
move ahead
try to detect it
it&rsquo;s not too late
to whip it
whip it good</p>

<p>When a good time turns around
You must whip it
You will never live it down
Unless you whip it
No one gets their way
Until they whip it</p>

<p>I say whip it
Whip it good</p>
