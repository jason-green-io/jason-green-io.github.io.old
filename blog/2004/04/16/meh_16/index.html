<p>Quite a slacker aren&rsquo;t I? I skipped another day! I meant to post last night, but I fell asleep during Survivor and only woke up at the end of The Apprentice, then I went to bed.</p>

<p>Nothing much new .. finally I got to watch a new Smallville episode. Hoping to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/">Kill Bill vol. 2</a> tonight. I bought <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/">Kill Bill vol. 1</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/">Two Towers</a> and <a href="">The Matrix: Revolutions</a>. I was hesitant in buying Kill Bill vol. 1 knowing they&rsquo;re going to release a special edition. Meh.</p>

<p>Proteus is out .. not that great. Still needs time to cook.</p>
