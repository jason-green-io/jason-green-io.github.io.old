<p>I am soooo not impresed right now&hellip; Wonderfalls got cancelled&hellip; I&rsquo;m am to the point of crying right now.. it&rsquo;s so sad.. fucking studio executives&hellip; fucking profit .. fucking self interest. That and I just got pretty much kicked out of the Paramount. Very very very bad combination. I&rsquo;ll post more more when I&rsquo;m sober.</p>

<p>Sorry Lyne.. I read the first line and I knew exactly what it was.. I remember drinking gallons of the stuff. I was busy at Paramount telling Marc Dupuis how I didn&rsquo;t like the fact that he wanted to throw me in the spit pit at Vanier. Next time you have have a question like that, call me, please!</p>
