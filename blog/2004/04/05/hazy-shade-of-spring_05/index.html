<p>For all you astronomy people out there, I found a very cool link. A <a href="http://cleardarksky.com/c/Monctonkey.html">Clear Sky Clock</a>. Tells you everything you need to know about current sky conditions for stargazing. <a href="http://cleardarksky.com/lp/Monctonlp.html">This is also VERY cool</a>.</p>
