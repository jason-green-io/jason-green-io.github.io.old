<p>I don&rsquo;t eat enough cereal.. in fact, I don&rsquo;t breakfast period. I should start .. eating cereal that is. I used to love Captain Crunch. That would have to be my all time fav, but I also liked Chex, Corn Pops, Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Lucky Charms. Then I&rsquo;d be forced to buy more milk, which I like but don&rsquo;t drink enough of. Have they solved the soggyness problems? I remember Chex being really good at preserving it&rsquo;s crunch factor after a long duration exposed to milk. I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m going buy some Chex.</p>
