<p>First image is of the IDC room at work, <em>Internet Data Center</em>. It&rsquo;s 4 of many cabinets, lots of interesting stuff in those, specially the last one on the right. Second image is my desk I share with my fellow co-workers. In the background are the shattered remains of what was once a busy service management center.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re bobbing along in our barrel
Some of us tip right over the edge
But there&rsquo;s one thing really mystifying
It&rsquo;s got me laughing, and it&rsquo;s got me crying
All my life it would be death-defying
Until I know
I wonder, wonder why the wonder falls
I wonder why the wonder falls on me
I wonder, wonder why the wonder falls
With everything I touch and hear and see</p>
