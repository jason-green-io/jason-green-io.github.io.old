<p>I started downloading The Screen Savers off of suprnova.org.. the only show I missed from when I had a dish. That rhymed. Leo Laport is no longer a host, Kevin Rose &ldquo;replaced&rdquo; him. Speaking of Kevin Rose, check out <a href="http://thebroken.org/">_thebroken.organization</a>, funny stuff, episode 3 has a great interview with Kevin Mitnick. Season 2 of Clone Wars started, awesome stuff.. watch that if you&rsquo;re a Star Wars fan. I&rsquo;m downloading episode 4 of Wonderfalls, can&rsquo;t wait to see it!! Sorry Gary for kinda spoiling Survivor.. I kept you in mind when I was posting.. but ultimately, I couldn&rsquo;t keep my big spoiling mouth shut. Now that Troy is gone from The Apprentice, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s worth watching.. I like Nick.. but I liked Troy better. I watched episode 5 of Kingdom Hospital .. I have no idea why I keep downloading it.. it&rsquo;s awful, but I need to know if it&rsquo;s going to get any better!</p>

<p>Working this weekend, this will be my last weekend working&hellip; WOOHOO! I&rsquo;ll still have to come in once in a while on a Sunday.. and sometimes stay till 8:30 on a Saturday morning. But that won&rsquo;t happen nearly as often than it used to.</p>

<p>Wow look at all that underlining!</p>
