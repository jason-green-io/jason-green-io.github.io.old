<p>I found the theme song to Kingdom Hospital, a song by Ivy called Worry About You, not sure if it&rsquo;s freaky because the intro to the show is burned in my mind with the song .. or the song is just, a little freaky by its own.. anywho, I like it. I was looking at <a href="http://alrob.gomen.org/cyn/">Cyn&rsquo;s</a> site, she&rsquo;s using categories.. I&rsquo;d love to use categories with MT, but I have no idea how/why to categorize my entries.. they all fit in the same category .. the &ldquo;stupid unstructured, sometimes funny, sometimes boring&rdquo; type. If you have any ideas, let me know.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my toolbox, bought it back in college. I used the the tools inside to create my Rubik&rsquo;s Cube variable 15V 0.5A power supply. A picture of <em>it</em> will be up during the weekend.</p>
