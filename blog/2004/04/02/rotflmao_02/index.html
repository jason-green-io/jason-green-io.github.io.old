<p>Damn that was a good episode! Wonderfalls is now my favorite show. They better not cancel it. I brought my camera at work, there&rsquo;s alot of interesting things to see, I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t take nice pictures. One I&rsquo;d like to try is a picture of the server room with the lights out.. should be cool with all the LEDs and such. I had a chicken pizziola sub and some Bawls for supper. While I was at Subway, there was a gaggle of goths .. or young caffeine addicted adolecents .. or something. One even had a Toshiba laptop and was listening some kind of heavy song. They all went to <a href="http://gzn-moncton.com/index.shtml">Ground Zero Netwroks</a>, I followed them there where I bought my <a href="http://www.bawls.com">Bawls</a>. I wonder if they have a wireless access point there? If they don&rsquo;t .. I might just donate one of my routers in exchange for free access.. wouldn&rsquo;t that be cool.</p>
