<p>Went out with Ned, his friends and Gary last night. Good times was had by all. Sunsun&rsquo;s afterwards at my place .. sooo good. Listening to Mother and Child Reunion by Paul Simon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reloading the <a href="http://www.proteusx.com/">Proteus</a> website for the past 4 days now, there&rsquo;s a new version coming out, can&rsquo;t wait to try it. It&rsquo;s a multi-IM client for OS X. The developer has had problems getting v.4 out, bugs and website problems&hellip;. cmon Justin, we&rsquo;re dying here.</p>

<blockquote><p>Many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve been mistaken
And many times confused
Yes, and I&rsquo;ve often felt forsaken
And certainly misused
Oh, but I&rsquo;m alright, I&rsquo;m alright
I&rsquo;m just weary to my bones</p></blockquote>
