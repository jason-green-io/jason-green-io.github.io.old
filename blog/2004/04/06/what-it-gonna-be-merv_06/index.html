<p>Just got back from Sounds Fantastic, Nic, Brad and I watched Matrix Revolutions on the projector with a kick ass sound system. The touch screen remote controls everything, including the motorized curtains. Quite a setup they&rsquo;ve got there. 45000 dollars worth of equipment. Nic wants it all.</p>
