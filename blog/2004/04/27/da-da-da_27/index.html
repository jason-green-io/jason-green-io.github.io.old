<p>Yup, I&rsquo;m still alive. I said I&rsquo;d enjoy my weekend, and I did. Spur the moment I decided to go up to Freddy and Woodstock to hang out with &ldquo;Flur&rdquo; and Ned. I got to meet Kabuki and see Kill Bill vol. 2 again. As usual, Woodstock was chock full of shock and awe entertainment.</p>

<p>Watched the hockey games tonight, too bad Habs lost .. but Go Flames Go!</p>

<p>Started a 2 week run of night shifts. 00:00 &ndash; 08:30. Not too bad, at least I have my evenings off.</p>

<p>Drunken TP this weekend, contact me for details.</p>

<p>Still no word from the Forces.</p>
