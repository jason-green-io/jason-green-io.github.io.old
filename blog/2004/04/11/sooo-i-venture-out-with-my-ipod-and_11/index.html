<p>Sooo, I venture out with my iPod and headphones, blasting tunes from my fav list. I get to Rodd&rsquo;s and switch from the harsh sidewalk to the more gentle and serene walking trail, that snakes the Peticodiac. 1755 started playing, at that point I decided this was a great time to listen to 1755 exclusively .. being in Moncton, walking outside at 5:00am, I was able to sing my lungs out without anyone hearing me .. except for maybe a few oil resevoirs .. who seemed to be flooded by the spring melt. I get to this mysterious &ldquo;after hours bar&rdquo; .. doors are locked, but there&rsquo;s people inside .. whom other than Marc Dupuis .. again, I&rsquo;m drunk and meet him, he&rsquo;s quite surprised, I even saw his lips voice my name to the other person, who I could not identify. He opens the door. I ask &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; .. he says &ldquo;we had to close the bar, not enough people to keep it open, and there was an &lsquo;incident&rsquo;&rdquo; .. hmm, okay .. &ldquo;what kind of &lsquo;incident&rsquo;?&rdquo; .. &ldquo;an &lsquo;incident&rsquo;&rdquo; .. alright.. &ldquo;s&#8217;oauira&rdquo;, and I left. Sang 1755 all the way back to downtown. All was not lost, I got a good workout. I picked up a chicken pizziola sub at Subway, then headed to GZN, bought 2 Bawls and played some 1st person WW2 shooter. Got my ass whipped by some guy called Bardock.. guy is half my age and can snipe someone in mid air with a railgun EVERYTIME. Amazing. The upcoming generation is VERY electronic/video game/computer savvy .. I&rsquo;m rethinking my career plan .. maybe teaching? Around 7:30 I take off, which brings me here, in my bed listening to Paul Simon.</p>

I don’t know where I’m going
I’m on my way
I’m taking my time
But I don’t know where</p></blockquote>
