<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m at Caro&rsquo;s. I just finished fixing her computer, woohoo! Such a good feeling fixing a problem I have no idea how to fix :) I&rsquo;m supposed to get a reward, I can&rsquo;t wait! Al&rsquo;s gone to the liquor store, I guess we&rsquo;re gonna party it hard Al style. Woohoo!</p></blockquote>

<p>I never did get that reward. I remember us joking about it being of a sexual nature though :) I haven&rsquo;t partied it hard Al style in a while .. I&rsquo;ve partied hard .. but not Al style.</p>
