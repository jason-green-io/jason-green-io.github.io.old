<p>I love Maglites. I hate replacing batteries. Solution, LEDs. I bought 2 EverLEDs, I put one in my Mag, w00t, it&rsquo;s bright and the batteries will last at least 3 times longer. I put one in my &ldquo;army&rdquo; camo light, with the colored filters. I can&rsquo;t wait to put them to the test.. I&rsquo;ve played around the apt a bit, and at work.. and one partook in the ritualistic burning of a VCR .. methyl hydride large hammer VCR = fun for the whole family.</p>

<p>The camo one with the red filter is going to come in handy during stargazing sessions. Oh! I read about how and why red lights are good in the dark, it&rsquo;s facinating, cones and rods and light wavelengths .. deep breath .. sorry I geeked out there.</p>
