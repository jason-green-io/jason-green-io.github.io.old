<blockquote><p>Groove is in the Heart is the first song I have learned by myself on a bass. It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m using to practice my speed and agility. I love it! Remi decided to start his own page, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/proremius/">Stuff in my Head</a>. If anyone else start his/her own online journal thing, I will have to severly beat them, it&rsquo;s become way out of hand! Notice the symbols on top, now it&rsquo;s illegal! Ha! Going to bed, I have a car tomorrow!! WOOHOO, I haven&rsquo;t had a car to go to college since, before way winter break.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can still play that song, and I play it as well as I did back then. Crappily. Many people did start they&rsquo;re own &ldquo;online journal thing&rdquo;, reffered to as blogs in the 21st century. Remi&rsquo;s is long gone. Now Ned and Monique have one .. I will have to severely beat them. The symbols I reffered to there were copywrite and trademark logos .. it was Lou&rsquo;s idea, they are also .. long gone.</p>
