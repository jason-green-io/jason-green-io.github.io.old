<p>I dunno, there was a packet of the stuff on the desk. I like iced tea, it&rsquo;s cool .. haha.. iced &ndash; cool .. get it? I don&rsquo;t actualy like tea. Apparently people who start drinking tea actually get addicted to it .. and if they don&rsquo;t get their fix they turn into grotesque monsters and devour small children.. I dunno, I heard that somewhere. I like it iced though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired of cola .. meaning Pepsi and Coke .. I think it&rsquo;s the bloating factor .. and the sugar .. meh .. I&rsquo;m going to start taking iced tea.. hopfully I won&rsquo;t eat any newborns. Is Rev carbonated? It feels carbonated.. but not overly carbonated, it&rsquo;s got a reasonably comfortable carbonation going on.</p>

<p>Carbonation station.</p>

<p>Carbonate it up there carbona .. carbar.. car.. whatever.</p>
