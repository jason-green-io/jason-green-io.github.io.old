<p>Kevin O&#8217;Brien is credited as being the first person to call me &ldquo;greener&rdquo;. Kevin was my neighbor when I moved to Dieppe in 91&#8217;. He was a huge hockey fan, and apparently there was a hockey announcer called &ldquo;greener&rdquo; .. or something .. so the name stuck, he never reffered to me using my real name. Then I met Nic, I started using &ldquo;greener&rdquo; as my handle, using his computer, on BBS&#8217; and online. He started calling me &ldquo;greener&rdquo; .. then it spread to Scouts .. then my parents .. then the world. Today, not everyone calls me &ldquo;greener&rdquo;, mostly an even distribution of &ldquo;Green&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jay&rdquo;. But here and there I&rsquo;ll get a &ldquo;hey greener!&rdquo; or a &ldquo;greener!&rdquo;.</p>
