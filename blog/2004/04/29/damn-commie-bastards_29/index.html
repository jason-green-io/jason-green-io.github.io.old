<p>They want total control of their code, nothing open so that people can go in and fix all the bugs their stupid engineers have written <em>cough</em> buffer overrun <em>cough</em>. Imagine if they&rsquo;d open up their code, with all the money they have, they&rsquo;d be able to make the world a better place, litterally .. AND make a profit. Meh, fuck them, I&rsquo;m sticking with Apple, my Mac does everything I want it to; 50x better than any Windows machine .. I know alot of people switching too, I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s a long term trend, slowly as people notice how much better Mac&rsquo;s are, and people let go of the misconceptions that were planted in their brains by Microsoft in the 80s and 90s, they will see the light.</p>
