<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m still sick! It&rsquo;s been 4 days now. COugh COugh. I think I&rsquo;m going to listen to Brendan Furlotte now. Nevermind.. I pressed play, and Ozzy started playing, I&rsquo;m more in the mood for Ozzy right now. :) I don&rsquo;t know why. I had 3 dreams last night.. and.. oh nevermind, you don&rsquo;t want to hear my problems. Besides, this page is for entertainment purposes only. No, not entertainment for you, for me. If it entertains you, good! It&rsquo;s a side effect of entertaining me. Oh.. I like the guitar here (Al, the solo in Crazy Train).. hehe Trazy Crain&hellip; grr. Oh yeah.. your Ozzy CD is still here. I think I&rsquo;m working today, sometime. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m going. I&rsquo;d cough and blow my nose constantly, that and spread the cold to the rest of human society, and thats anti-evolutionary.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes .. entertainment for me. That&rsquo;s a good reminder. You hear that you/me of the future? I remember when I typed that .. I was quite freaked out .. and I still have some &ldquo;grr&rdquo; left.</p>

<p>anti-evolutionary .. wow, what happened to my vocabulary?</p>
