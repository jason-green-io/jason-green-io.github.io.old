<p>I wonder if I can still pull off that 86 .. I&rsquo;d have to post 50some entries today .. I think it&rsquo;s possible. I promise not to cheat, like posting one word entries, I&rsquo;ll try and make them as interesting as <em>I</em> possibly can. It&rsquo;s going to be tough, I&rsquo;m going to have to start a list of things to talk about, a list of 54 subjects.. and talk about them. Wow, what could a list like that look like?</p>
