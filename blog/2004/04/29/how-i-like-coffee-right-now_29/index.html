<p>I&rsquo;d like a coffee right now. Any kind of wake-up juice. I&rsquo;m getting drowsy, but I don&rsquo;t want to make a full pot. I might go to Subway and get one. Maybe I&rsquo;ll go get the car and go to Tim&rsquo;s .. mmm Tim&rsquo;s. Too bad GZN isn&rsquo;t open, I&rsquo;d get me some Bawls.</p>
