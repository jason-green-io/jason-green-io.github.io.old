<p>It&rsquo;s really early, I&rsquo;m in bed listening to ABBA. I did nothing tonight, except watch the latest Enterprise episode and Conan. Speaking of TV shows.. I started watching The O.C.; I&rsquo;m totally addicted to that show. There&rsquo;s something about it&rsquo;s soap opera&#8217;ish qualities that just sucked me in. Fucking Oliver Trast, I despise him!</p>

<p>I bought Glade plug-ins refils, they smell really nice, my bedroom door is open and I can barely smell it.. very tropical, <em>snifff</em> ahhhhhh.</p>

<p>Damn I&rsquo;m boring.</p>

<p>I climb the walls of my mind just like I&rsquo;m climbing on a jungle gym
I am more than content with the
state of mind I am in
&lsquo;cause I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.
I don&rsquo;t think I need a rubber room,
but hey, that might be nice
I&rsquo;m not a manic depressive paranoid or schizophrenic so I don&rsquo;t need your advice.
I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.
The lights are on but nobody&rsquo;s home
my elevator doesn&rsquo;t go to the top
I&rsquo;m not playing with a full deck
I&rsquo;ve lost my marbles
The lights are on but nobody&rsquo;s home
my elevator doesn&rsquo;t go to the top
I&rsquo;m not playing with a full deck
I&rsquo;ve lost my marbles.
I&rsquo;m a few bricks short of a load,
but a full load always hurt my back.
I flew over the cuckoo&rsquo;s nest and
I&rsquo;m never ever coming back because
I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.
I am crazy.</p>
