<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s still on on CBC. I remember watching it every Sunday night when I was young. Lion King is the feature tonight. I haven&rsquo;t seen that in a while. &ldquo;They call meeee, MISTER PIG!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>New Years was great! Oxygen with Monique, Ned and Ryan. I met someone I hadn&rsquo;t spoken to in 6 years. Looks like we might be speaking more in the near future ;)</p>
