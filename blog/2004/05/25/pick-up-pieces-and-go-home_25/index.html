<p>Hello my fellow blog readers. How are you today? I am great right now. I just re-replied to a semi-important email that has to do with New Years Eve and a failed relationship. I&rsquo;m listening to Fleetwood Mac, I&rsquo;m looking for a certain acoustic cool tune that Steven played tonight .. I still haven&rsquo;t found it. Frig, I need to go get a sub before the sun comes up.</p>

<p>brb</p>

<p>Alright, I&rsquo;m back.. and I bet you&rsquo;re wondering why I &ldquo;need&rdquo; to get a sub before sunrise .. it&rsquo;s not because all the SubWays turn into pumkins or anything like that .. it&rsquo;s so I can eat the sub and go to sleep while it&rsquo;s still dark, so that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about light in my room because I&rsquo;ll be sleeping .. all I&rsquo;ll have to worry about are the friken bells .. which shouldn&rsquo;t ring on a weekday .. but there might be more traffic becasue it&rsquo;s the day after a holiday.</p>
