<p>Gary&rsquo;s got a blog! You can find it in in the side bar, on the top .. yes Ryan, he&rsquo;s on the top.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s new with me .. well, I bought shaving cream and shaved .. umm, I cleaned the kitchen .. what else. .. as you can see, nothing much new. Nothing to talk about anyway, yet. Got the CF application, it&rsquo;s mostly filled out, I have to do some research on where I&rsquo;ve been working and living; with addresses and postal codes and addresses, in the past 10 years.. it&rsquo;ll take a few days, I&rsquo;ve moved 5 times since &lsquo;91.</p>

<p>I bought a new cell, it&rsquo;s a T730, ditched the bluetooth/270c combo since the firmware Bell/Aliant has doesn&rsquo;t enable the bluetooth module. If anyone wants it, or knows someone who does, let me know. It might work with Telus, not sure.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>
