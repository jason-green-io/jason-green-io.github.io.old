<p>Al, Ned and I drank our faces off last afternoon/night. Played video games, listened to some tunes. Lyne dropped by, I tried to fix Elliot, no go, not sure if it&rsquo;s the battery or the logic board, it seems to forget what time it is, could be the internal battery. Watched a South Park episode, a Smallville episode, Ned&rsquo;s projects and parts of a Bruce Lee movie (the fighting scenes), then we ventured out to &ldquo;the complex&rdquo;. Stayed there for a while then went to Doc&rsquo;s for closing .. surprise surprise Doyle was there! We meant to call him earlier, but totally forgot. Hung out with him then went home .. sleep .. 4 hours later, woke up for work. Blah.</p>

<p>CF application is in the mail, waiting for it.</p>
