<p>Just got back from Subway, bought coffee and a sub. My hands are cold. Can&rsquo;t wait to get home and watch &ldquo;my shows&rdquo;. Specially the O.C. finale. Pretty soon the sun will be blinding me, see, my desk changed places, I have a really nice view of &ldquo;the Bend&rdquo; and Main/Champlain streets now.</p>
