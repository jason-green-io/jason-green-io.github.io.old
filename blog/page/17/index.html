  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mouhouhahahaha!!! I skipped another day! Nic and I went geocaching yesterday .. out of 4 caches we found 0. I think most of them were out of season. We got to a very cool one in Freddy, on the north side, some kind of volcano thing full of pine trees, pretty cool.</p>

<p>I started playing Tetris again, I beat my high score. 301306 starting off on level 9. This is with Tetris DX. I also uninstalled the POT for my afterburner and resoldered a few connections that looked crappy .. some still look crappy, but it works.</p>

<p>Very nice day today.. it a &ldquo;beer on Main street&rdquo; kind of day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quite a slacker aren&rsquo;t I? I skipped another day! I meant to post last night, but I fell asleep during Survivor and only woke up at the end of The Apprentice, then I went to bed.</p>

<p>Nothing much new .. finally I got to watch a new Smallville episode. Hoping to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/">Kill Bill vol. 2</a> tonight. I bought <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/">Kill Bill vol. 1</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/">Two Towers</a> and <a href="">The Matrix: Revolutions</a>. I was hesitant in buying Kill Bill vol. 1 knowing they&rsquo;re going to release a special edition. Meh.</p>

<p>Proteus is out .. not that great. Still needs time to cook.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I start my &ldquo;extended vacation&rdquo; June 11th. I got laid off. I saw it coming a mile away, not surprised. Soooo.. Ned, that means we&rsquo;re going to Calgary .. Al if you want to come .. book vacation anytime after June 11th.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t post yesterday because I didn&rsquo;t feel like it.. but there&rsquo;s plenty to say. Nic and I went to Paramount .. Mullet Monday&rsquo;s. Of course we drank .. alot. I didn&rsquo;t get kicked out though! I made a point to tell the bartender, who was there as a patron, that I was walking out on my on own volition :) We try to go to the mystic after-hours bar that is always closed after-hours. Walk there .. it&rsquo;s closed. So we pick up some food at Subway on Main after we were professionally told by the night manager (imagine the Simpsons fast food teenage nerd guy) that they don&rsquo;t serve &ldquo;walkers&rdquo;. Walk to another after-hours bar we think is open .. Miss Behaven .. also closed, so we take a cab home. I get to my place .. no keys. Locked out. Back to Subway for coffee, guy says I got Bawls if you want some .. he bought a case of the stuff .. ohhh sweeeet. So I buy some Bawls from him. I go to work .. at 5:30, working at 8:30. Talked to Luc for a bit then slept on the couch till 8:00. My boss Michael pulls me in the office and tells me the news and says I can go home. Laid off. No keys. Locked out. I keep working, Joker gets home around 2:30. I go home. At that point I had had 2 hours of sleep in 30 hours. Went to bed.</p>

<p>Slept 12 hours which brings me here, and Proteus is still not out!!!!!!!!!!!! I didn&rsquo;t post yesterday, first day I skip I think. I theoritically could make 86 posts, but I was looking at the posts I made 4 years ago .. some are just one line .. that&rsquo;s not fair, I don&rsquo;t post tiny posts like that as often as I used to. So I think I&rsquo;m changing the rules to my own contest (because I&rsquo;m judge number 1 of 1 on the panel, and I lead the board of directors). Instead of posting 86, I&rsquo;ll post as least once per day. Let me know if this is acceptable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As of today, April 2004 is the 3rd highest posting month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m done downloading the latest That 70s Show, still downloading the latest Sopranos. I&rsquo;ll be watching those when I get home with Al at .. 5:00 PM, w00t! No more waking up really early and getting home after supper, no way. Paramout tonight .. I&rsquo;m going try and not get kicked out this time. In fact, I think I&rsquo;ll only be drinking agua.</p>

<p>Ouvrez vos vitres, y start a faire nice dehors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lyne and I had a rematch after our stalemate match 2 weeks ago. She won one round, and I won the next .. after I had much more to drink than she did, hihihi. What a great time, I love playing Trivial Pursuit with her because she&rsquo;s the olnly person who can challenge me. If anyone reading this thinks they can beat me, please, let me know, I would love to kick your ass!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a picture Lynie took while in a plane, she had that as her desktop picture on her (my old) iBook. Very cool picture.</p>

<p>Wow, by this time 4 years ago, I was up to 41 posts. That would explain alot.. I posted 40 posts is 10 days.. I have not matched that yet. If I am to beat my last records, I need to post WAY more.. the only poroblem is that I don&rsquo;t have much to say.. I mean, I&rsquo;m not the kind of person to talk just for the sake of talking.. so I better get involved in something interesting so that I can post about it. What&rsquo;s interesting .. and worth posting about .. I need to get into some kind of relationship .. wouldn&rsquo;t that be cool .. me getting into a relationship for the soul purpose of blogging about it.. and I wouldn&rsquo;t tell this person .. it&rsquo;d be 100% just for my blog&rsquo;s content. Heheh.. so devious.. let&rsquo;s see if I can pull it off.</p>

<p>Cab driver said there was an after hours bar open in Dieppe, close to the Pizza Delight .. I&rsquo;m walking there right now, lets see if I can&rsquo;t get some content for my site there .. mouhouhouhahahahaha!!! (I am now evil).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sooo, I venture out with my iPod and headphones, blasting tunes from my fav list. I get to Rodd&rsquo;s and switch from the harsh sidewalk to the more gentle and serene walking trail, that snakes the Peticodiac. 1755 started playing, at that point I decided this was a great time to listen to 1755 exclusively .. being in Moncton, walking outside at 5:00am, I was able to sing my lungs out without anyone hearing me .. except for maybe a few oil resevoirs .. who seemed to be flooded by the spring melt. I get to this mysterious &ldquo;after hours bar&rdquo; .. doors are locked, but there&rsquo;s people inside .. whom other than Marc Dupuis .. again, I&rsquo;m drunk and meet him, he&rsquo;s quite surprised, I even saw his lips voice my name to the other person, who I could not identify. He opens the door. I ask &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; .. he says &ldquo;we had to close the bar, not enough people to keep it open, and there was an &lsquo;incident&rsquo;&rdquo; .. hmm, okay .. &ldquo;what kind of &lsquo;incident&rsquo;?&rdquo; .. &ldquo;an &lsquo;incident&rsquo;&rdquo; .. alright.. &ldquo;s&#8217;oauira&rdquo;, and I left. Sang 1755 all the way back to downtown. All was not lost, I got a good workout. I picked up a chicken pizziola sub at Subway, then headed to GZN, bought 2 Bawls and played some 1st person WW2 shooter. Got my ass whipped by some guy called Bardock.. guy is half my age and can snipe someone in mid air with a railgun EVERYTIME. Amazing. The upcoming generation is VERY electronic/video game/computer savvy .. I&rsquo;m rethinking my career plan .. maybe teaching? Around 7:30 I take off, which brings me here, in my bed listening to Paul Simon.</p>

I don’t know where I’m going

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went out with Ned, his friends and Gary last night. Good times was had by all. Sunsun&rsquo;s afterwards at my place .. sooo good. Listening to Mother and Child Reunion by Paul Simon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reloading the <a href="http://www.proteusx.com/">Proteus</a> website for the past 4 days now, there&rsquo;s a new version coming out, can&rsquo;t wait to try it. It&rsquo;s a multi-IM client for OS X. The developer has had problems getting v.4 out, bugs and website problems&hellip;. cmon Justin, we&rsquo;re dying here.</p>

<blockquote><p>Many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve been mistaken
And many times confused
Yes, and I&rsquo;ve often felt forsaken
And certainly misused
Oh, but I&rsquo;m alright, I&rsquo;m alright
I&rsquo;m just weary to my bones</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was on my way to work I met Martin in the atrium. I hadn&rsquo;t talked to him in quite a while, looks like we&rsquo;re going sea kayaking in 2 weeks. I&rsquo;m bidding on a bluetooth module for my phone, finally. Prices on those are low now, since the phone is soo old. I&rsquo;ll be able to update my blog in very unlikely places .. I&rsquo;ll also be able to transfer phone numbers to and from my phone .. very important since I don&rsquo;t have a backup of numbers on my phone.</p>
