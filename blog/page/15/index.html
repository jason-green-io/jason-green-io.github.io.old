I pressed play, and Ozzy started playing, I&rsquo;m more in the mood for Ozzy right now. :) I don&rsquo;t know why. I had 3 dreams last night.. and.. oh nevermind, you don&rsquo;t want to hear my problems. Besides, this page is for entertainment purposes only. No, not entertainment for you, for me. If it entertains you, good! It&rsquo;s a side effect of entertaining me. Oh.. I like the guitar here (Al, the solo in Crazy Train).. hehe Trazy Crain&hellip; grr. Oh yeah.. your Ozzy CD is still here. I think I&rsquo;m working today, sometime. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m going. I&rsquo;d cough and blow my nose constantly, that and spread the cold to the rest of human society, and thats anti-evolutionary.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes .. entertainment for me. That&rsquo;s a good reminder. You hear that you/me of the future? I remember when I typed that .. I was quite freaked out .. and I still have some &ldquo;grr&rdquo; left.</p>

<p>anti-evolutionary .. wow, what happened to my vocabulary?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m in math class right now. Again, will be transfering this to digital format in an hour or so. Get Real was pretty good last night. I would have liked to see the other episodes instead of the season finale first. Got Pepsi again, it&rsquo;s a ritual now. Coincidence? Some guy (Derrick) is singing the theme song to Degrassi Junior High. Second time I hear it in 3 days, after it&rsquo;s absence of my auditory system for more than 4 years. Weird stuff is going on this week. Just met Mike, the pilot. He&rsquo;s trying to get scheduled to fly in the twin engine, but no such luck. I offered to pay my way sometime to get a ride with him. I love flying, I don&rsquo;t do it enough. I think I&rsquo;m going to buy a helicopter. My mother is supposed to get her big check today, I wonder if she can lend me 3*10<sup>3</sup> $. iMac&hellip; Time for a sip of my Pepsi. If I was in a band I would like it to be called The Indefinite Integrals. This pen kicks ass. My father has crappy hand wirtting, I noticed something about mine, it&rsquo;s crappy too. I brought my walkman to college today, and all my mix tapes -1, Warmnfuzzy Beatles. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m going to even have a chance to use it. I only want to use it when I&rsquo;m alone, because I find people listening to walkmans in public to be a bit anti-social on their part. I dunno. Kinda like crossing your arms when talking to someone. Hi Jeff if you&rsquo;re reading this. This is begining to be a bit long. I never write for this length of time. It&rsquo;s wierd. I&rsquo;m on my second page, this is amazing! Well.. amazing for.. me, maybe not for you. I&rsquo;m stopping now.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;A la revoyure!&rdquo; &ndash; Le Grand Mahdn&#8221;</p>

<p>Haaa, good times. Jeff was sitting right next to me, and he was litterally looking at my screen, at what I was typing, so I typed that just to let him know I knew he was looking at my screen.. damn bastard. I still have all those mixes, if you&rsquo;ve been in my car recently, some of them are spread across the dash. I need to digitise them .. meaning .. download from Acquisition and make an iTunes playlist. I no longer think people listening to music in public are anti-social. I do it myself .. they don&rsquo;t mean to shut people out .. they just want to listen to cool tunes. I&rsquo;m all for listening to cool tunes. Crossing arms though.. it&rsquo;s a sign of defensiveness.</p>

<p>I never did get that reward. I remember us joking about it being of a sexual nature though :) I haven&rsquo;t partied it hard Al style in a while .. I&rsquo;ve partied hard .. but not Al style.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Groove is in the Heart is the first song I have learned by myself on a bass. It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m using to practice my speed and agility. I love it! Remi decided to start his own page, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/proremius/">Stuff in my Head</a>. If anyone else start his/her own online journal thing, I will have to severly beat them, it&rsquo;s become way out of hand! Notice the symbols on top, now it&rsquo;s illegal! Ha! Going to bed, I have a car tomorrow!! WOOHOO, I haven&rsquo;t had a car to go to college since, before way winter break.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can still play that song, and I play it as well as I did back then. Crappily. Many people did start they&rsquo;re own &ldquo;online journal thing&rdquo;, reffered to as blogs in the 21st century. Remi&rsquo;s is long gone. Now Ned and Monique have one .. I will have to severely beat them. The symbols I reffered to there were copywrite and trademark logos .. it was Lou&rsquo;s idea, they are also .. long gone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kevin O&#8217;Brien is credited as being the first person to call me &ldquo;greener&rdquo;. Kevin was my neighbor when I moved to Dieppe in 91&#8217;. He was a huge hockey fan, and apparently there was a hockey announcer called &ldquo;greener&rdquo; .. or something .. so the name stuck, he never reffered to me using my real name. Then I met Nic, I started using &ldquo;greener&rdquo; as my handle, using his computer, on BBS&#8217; and online. He started calling me &ldquo;greener&rdquo; .. then it spread to Scouts .. then my parents .. then the world. Today, not everyone calls me &ldquo;greener&rdquo;, mostly an even distribution of &ldquo;Green&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jay&rdquo;. But here and there I&rsquo;ll get a &ldquo;hey greener!&rdquo; or a &ldquo;greener!&rdquo;.</p>
