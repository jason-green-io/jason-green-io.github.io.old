<p>I hope Doc&rsquo;s door is open tomorrow. I&rsquo;m heading there as soon as I wake up. Beer, outside. I am sooooo wearing shorts tomorrow! Pfft &ldquo;better than Doc&rsquo;s&rdquo; .. Moe .. nothing is better than Doc&rsquo;s .. naaating! Too bad I&rsquo;ll be sleeping most of the day, I won&rsquo;t be able to take full advantage, but tits okay, I prefer the evening, when it goes from warm to cool. Ohhh.. maybe the hockey game will be on the big screen! Who wants to go!! Oh wait.. most of the people who read this are not in Moncton, and the ones who are in town most likely have better things to do. Oh well, I&rsquo;ll go downtown alone, again. Sigh.</p>

<p>I wonder if I can still pull off that 86 .. I&rsquo;d have to post 50some entries today .. I think it&rsquo;s possible. I promise not to cheat, like posting one word entries, I&rsquo;ll try and make them as interesting as <em>I</em> possibly can. It&rsquo;s going to be tough, I&rsquo;m going to have to start a list of things to talk about, a list of 54 subjects.. and talk about them. Wow, what could a list like that look like?</p>

<p>I really need to go stargazing .. with the help of that new clear sky clock I found, it&rsquo;s going to even easier. They even have topo maps .. all I have to do is find a spot with no city light influence and with enough elevation to have a 360 degree view .. and I&rsquo;ll be all set. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen the sky on a truely clear night .. Moncton has always been a factor, even in Fundy you lose a magnitude or two.</p>

<p>2 comets will be making an appearance soon .. 2 .. yeah, at the same time, should be cool. I&rsquo;m not sure of the dates. I downloaded Starry Night Pro a few weeks back .. it has a built in Hertzsprung Russell diagram pretty friken cool man.</p>

<p>I know, I know, it&rsquo;s kinda cheating, commenting on past entries. But some people probally have never read those .. and it&rsquo;s fun commenting on old stuff. Entertainment for me .. right. I think it was a good idea. I&rsquo;ve got another 5 lined up comming after the next 15 entries. After those 5, that&rsquo;s it. I just though of something.. what happens if I decide to do this again.. try to beat my record.. blah&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to beat me record again. doing it once is enough. I think. .. oh well.. I&rsquo;ll deal with that if I ever decide to do it again.</p>

<p>Kevin O&#8217;Brien is credited as being the first person to call me &ldquo;greener&rdquo;. Kevin was my neighbor when I moved to Dieppe in 91&#8217;. He was a huge hockey fan, and apparently there was a hockey announcer called &ldquo;greener&rdquo; .. or something .. so the name stuck, he never reffered to me using my real name. Then I met Nic, I started using &ldquo;greener&rdquo; as my handle, using his computer, on BBS&#8217; and online. He started calling me &ldquo;greener&rdquo; .. then it spread to Scouts .. then my parents .. then the world. Today, not everyone calls me &ldquo;greener&rdquo;, mostly an even distribution of &ldquo;Green&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jay&rdquo;. But here and there I&rsquo;ll get a &ldquo;hey greener!&rdquo; or a &ldquo;greener!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take some time here and talk about cat-5 cable .. I&rsquo;ve been seeing an interesting trend lately .. alot of stuff it using it. There&rsquo;s an HDTV signal extender that&rsquo;s coming out soon that uses it .. there are USB AND Firewire extenders that use the stuff. The new Airport base stations that Apple makes has always used it BUT! they can now be powered by cat-5 .. that&rsquo;s right, it can also power low power devices .. perfect for wireless access points. I&rsquo;m thinking you need to dedicate 1 of the pairs to power and may need to hook up the network in power compatible hubs or something.. I dunno, haven&rsquo;t had time to look it up, but I will eventually.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m still sick! It&rsquo;s been 4 days now. COugh COugh. I think I&rsquo;m going to listen to Brendan Furlotte now. Nevermind.. I pressed play, and Ozzy started playing, I&rsquo;m more in the mood for Ozzy right now. :) I don&rsquo;t know why. I had 3 dreams last night.. and.. oh nevermind, you don&rsquo;t want to hear my problems. Besides, this page is for entertainment purposes only. No, not entertainment for you, for me. If it entertains you, good! It&rsquo;s a side effect of entertaining me. Oh.. I like the guitar here (Al, the solo in Crazy Train).. hehe Trazy Crain&hellip; grr. Oh yeah.. your Ozzy CD is still here. I think I&rsquo;m working today, sometime. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m going. I&rsquo;d cough and blow my nose constantly, that and spread the cold to the rest of human society, and thats anti-evolutionary.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes .. entertainment for me. That&rsquo;s a good reminder. You hear that you/me of the future? I remember when I typed that .. I was quite freaked out .. and I still have some &ldquo;grr&rdquo; left.</p>

<p>anti-evolutionary .. wow, what happened to my vocabulary?</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m in math class right now. Again, will be transfering this to digital format in an hour or so. Get Real was pretty good last night. I would have liked to see the other episodes instead of the season finale first. Got Pepsi again, it&rsquo;s a ritual now. Coincidence? Some guy (Derrick) is singing the theme song to Degrassi Junior High. Second time I hear it in 3 days, after it&rsquo;s absence of my auditory system for more than 4 years. Weird stuff is going on this week. Just met Mike, the pilot. He&rsquo;s trying to get scheduled to fly in the twin engine, but no such luck. I offered to pay my way sometime to get a ride with him. I love flying, I don&rsquo;t do it enough. I think I&rsquo;m going to buy a helicopter. My mother is supposed to get her big check today, I wonder if she can lend me 3*10<sup>3</sup> $. iMac&hellip; Time for a sip of my Pepsi. If I was in a band I would like it to be called The Indefinite Integrals. This pen kicks ass. My father has crappy hand wirtting, I noticed something about mine, it&rsquo;s crappy too. I brought my walkman to college today, and all my mix tapes -1, Warmnfuzzy Beatles. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m going to even have a chance to use it. I only want to use it when I&rsquo;m alone, because I find people listening to walkmans in public to be a bit anti-social on their part. I dunno. Kinda like crossing your arms when talking to someone. Hi Jeff if you&rsquo;re reading this. This is begining to be a bit long. I never write for this length of time. It&rsquo;s wierd. I&rsquo;m on my second page, this is amazing! Well.. amazing for.. me, maybe not for you. I&rsquo;m stopping now.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;A la revoyure!&rdquo; &ndash; Le Grand Mahdn&#8221;</p>

<p>Haaa, good times. Jeff was sitting right next to me, and he was litterally looking at my screen, at what I was typing, so I typed that just to let him know I knew he was looking at my screen.. damn bastard. I still have all those mixes, if you&rsquo;ve been in my car recently, some of them are spread across the dash. I need to digitise them .. meaning .. download from Acquisition and make an iTunes playlist. I no longer think people listening to music in public are anti-social. I do it myself .. they don&rsquo;t mean to shut people out .. they just want to listen to cool tunes. I&rsquo;m all for listening to cool tunes. Crossing arms though.. it&rsquo;s a sign of defensiveness.</p>
