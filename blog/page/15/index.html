  <p>I’m still sick! It’s been 4 days now. COugh COugh. I think I’m going to listen to Brendan Furlotte now. Nevermind.. I pressed play, and Ozzy started playing, I’m more in the mood for Ozzy right now. :) I don’t know why. I had 3 dreams last night.. and.. oh nevermind, you don’t want to hear my problems. Besides, this page is for entertainment purposes only. No, not entertainment for you, for me. If it entertains you, good! It’s a side effect of entertaining me. Oh.. I like the guitar here (Al, the solo in Crazy Train).. hehe Trazy Crain… grr. Oh yeah.. your Ozzy CD is still here. I think I’m working today, sometime. I don’t know if I’m going. I’d cough and blow my nose constantly, that and spread the cold to the rest of human society, and thats anti-evolutionary.</p>

<p>Yes .. entertainment for me. That’s a good reminder. You hear that you/me of the future? I remember when I typed that .. I was quite freaked out .. and I still have some “grr” left.</p>

  <p>I’m in math class right now. Again, will be transfering this to digital format in an hour or so. Get Real was pretty good last night. I would have liked to see the other episodes instead of the season finale first. Got Pepsi again, it’s a ritual now. Coincidence? Some guy (Derrick) is singing the theme song to Degrassi Junior High. Second time I hear it in 3 days, after it’s absence of my auditory system for more than 4 years. Weird stuff is going on this week. Just met Mike, the pilot. He’s trying to get scheduled to fly in the twin engine, but no such luck. I offered to pay my way sometime to get a ride with him. I love flying, I don’t do it enough. I think I’m going to buy a helicopter. My mother is supposed to get her big check today, I wonder if she can lend me 3*10^3 $. iMac… Time for a sip of my Pepsi. If I was in a band I would like it to be called The Indefinite Integrals. This pen kicks ass. My father has crappy hand wirtting, I noticed something about mine, it’s crappy too. I brought my walkman to college today, and all my mix tapes -1, Warmnfuzzy Beatles. I’m not sure I’m going to even have a chance to use it. I only want to use it when I’m alone, because I find people listening to walkmans in public to be a bit anti-social on their part. I dunno. Kinda like crossing your arms when talking to someone. Hi Jeff if you’re reading this. This is begining to be a bit long. I never write for this length of time. It’s wierd. I’m on my second page, this is amazing! Well.. amazing for.. me, maybe not for you. I’m stopping now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“A la revoyure!” - Le Grand Mahdn”</p>

<p>Haaa, good times. Jeff was sitting right next to me, and he was litterally looking at my screen, at what I was typing, so I typed that just to let him know I knew he was looking at my screen.. damn bastard. I still have all those mixes, if you’ve been in my car recently, some of them are spread across the dash. I need to digitise them .. meaning .. download from Acquisition and make an iTunes playlist. I no longer think people listening to music in public are anti-social. I do it myself .. they don’t mean to shut people out .. they just want to listen to cool tunes. I’m all for listening to cool tunes. Crossing arms though.. it’s a sign of defensiveness.</p>

  <p>Groove is in the Heart is the first song I have learned by myself on a bass. It’s what I’m using to practice my speed and agility. I love it!

If anyone else start his/her own online journal thing, I will have to severly beat them, it’s become way out of hand! Notice the symbols on top, now it’s illegal! Ha!

<p>I can still play that song, and I play it as well as I did back then. Crappily. Many people did start they’re own “online journal thing”, reffered to as blogs in the 21st century. Remi’s is long gone. Now Ned and Monique have one .. I will have to severely beat them. The symbols I reffered to there were copywrite and trademark logos .. it was Lou’s idea, they are also .. long gone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kevin O’Brien is credited as being the first person to call me “greener”. Kevin was my neighbor when I moved to Dieppe in 91’. He was a huge hockey fan, and apparently there was a hockey announcer called “greener” .. or something .. so the name stuck, he never reffered to me using my real name. Then I met Nic, I started using “greener” as my handle, using his computer, on BBS’ and online. He started calling me “greener” .. then it spread to Scouts .. then my parents .. then the world. Today, not everyone calls me “greener”, mostly an even distribution of “Green” and “Jay”. But here and there I’ll get a “hey greener!” or a “greener!”.</p>
