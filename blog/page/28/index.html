  <div class="entry-content"><p>S in 1, S in 2, A in 3, A in 4 and C in 5.. that gives us 6. Level six is indescribable.. it’s really really cool. We’ll be able to get an A in that pretty soon. (I’m talking about Contra, I’m in an another marathon) Al pointed out I missed another day.. I did, sadly. But my constant flow of entries is a significant improvement over last year. If I can keep it up for 2003, I might actually attract more readers. naaaa.. if I’d want to attract more readers my writing would have to be least on par with Al’s, if not Lynie’s, but it’s not.</p>

<p>I currently look like a real hardcore geek, I haven’t shaved in a week, I’m wearing my ripped “got root?” t-shirt, with a white t-shirt underneath, green multi-pocket-convertible pants, my Matrix hat and a timex watch.. w00t w00t. All I need is a can of Dr. Pepper in my hand.</p>

<p>Al gave me his serrated bread knife, one less kitchen utensil I need to buy, thank you! I got a battery for my Photon light, it was dead.. I bought the battery at Radio Shack, I was at the mall at 9:30 not knowing the stores only open at 10:00. It came with a warranty, if it goes dead within 3 years they’ll give me 2 free new ones. It’s a good deal, but I’m sure there something behind that that I don’t know. Damn corporations and their seemingly amazing service.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Didn’t go to Doc’s, I think they were closed.. didn’t go to <a href="http://greener.sdf1.org/blog2/archives/bigstoplady.html">Big Stop</a> either, didn’t want to drive. Instead I went home and made grill cheeses. So “today” is my first day off in the overnight schedule. I have all morning off. Lucky I know exactly what is open 24 hours. I wish there were deals if you buy something at 4:30 in the morning.. like an incentive. That would be cool. I can only find lyrics to one song by 1755.. I think it means the rest are not transcribed. I am so going to digitize the lyrics and put them here.</p>

<p>Let me talk about lightbulbs for a minute.. aren’t they cool. I haven’t gone on and talked about nothing in particular in a long time.. just talk and talk and talk. That’s what I’ll do now. So I’m listening to Michigan Militia by Moxy Fruvous.. odd song, don’t like it much.. something I downloaded with Acquisition. Switch songs.. now.. please.. ahhhh.. thank you.. and it’s Word Up sung by Mel B.. I remember this song from the days when I worked at CPC, it would play at the end of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.. incidentally, Austin Powers: Goldmember is playing on Express VU. I watched the Golden Globes tonight.. and Edie Falco’s fake boob was sticking out, pretty sad, but she still rocks.. and she also had laryngitis. Hah I had to check the spelling for laryngitis.. but I actually got it right.. wow. I’m hungry.. I need “breakfast”.</p>

<p>That’s better, just got out of the shower, but you didn’t know I was in the shower.. but I know you thought something was up when I switched paragraphs.</p>

<p>Mmmmm..</p>

<p>Longue journée
Qui s’achève dans une chambre foncée
J’entends au loin les sirenes
Qui comme une vague me tirent, m’amènent
Chez Morphée
Emerveillé
Ce doux piège
Ou les gammes en délire s’arpègent
M’emportent si loin des villes
Et je fuis,
je fuis les escadrilles du privelège
Beau sortilège
On solde les vieux pays au marché des gorilles
Caché dans les bras de Morphée je rène
Nemo en exil
Sur mes rêves fragiles</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My landlord gets his kids every weekend. Now that I’m on the graveyard shift, this is very annoying. All day, while I was trying to sleep, I heard kids seemingly running back and forth on the second floor. I did manage to fall asleep a few times, and between 19:03 and 21:00 it was great, they weren’t there. Then they arrived and I had to wake up and go to work.</p>

<p>I’m still working on the site design, I’m having difficulties making it look good in all browsers. Why can’t everybody get along and use the same standard (Microsoft). I’m posting now so it appears the 18th.</p>

<p>Hey, I’m gonna bring my camera tomorrow and take pictures! I’m becoming one of those people who always have a camera and need to capture every single moment.. oh well, at least I don’t ask people to pose. I hate that.</p>

<p>I redesigned the site again, making the blog.. THE site. I’ll figure out a way to get the galleries back, but I’m not rushed. Now I need to take a shower, eat and play Contra. Gonna need some munchies and more pop. I also need a new 30W bulb for one of my lamps. Can’t wait to get paid, I have a list of stuff I’m going to buy for my kitchen, so I can start cooking. (keep the “yeah right” commentaries to yourselves, in fact, I’m going disable comments on this one, ha!</p>

<p>I’m going to take a picture now, of something random and put it up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>p&gt;So I’m sitting there right.. and I’m really thirsty, but my usual water bottle with the letters inked in red marker spelling “Greener” is no where to be found. So then it hits me, like most things do at 6:00, I have 2 cans of V8 in the fridge. Cold V8 is wonderful. It’s like drinking solid food. You feel your stomach is full when you drink V8. I love V8.</p>

<p>I have my iBook here at work.. but it’s not connected to the net. I wish it was. I hate using windows. My neck hurts.. not quite sure why.. and I think I have an ear infection. Every time I have a burb/spasm, my left ear pains me. I’ll let it go a few days and if it’s still bad, I’ll get it checked.</p>

<p>I’m done both cans, but I’m still thirsty. I’m going to go fill the cans with water. I just thought of something interesting, they have bottle water.. why don’t they have canned water? I’m sure there must be a perfectly good explanation. That’ll give me something to do, after I fill my cans with water. Wow.. is it ever weird drinking water out of a can.. if you’ve never tried it.. do. And now the search begins for canned water. OMG</p>

<p><img src="http://greener.sdf1.org/blog/archives/SSI70341.gif" alt="SSI70341.gif" /></p>

<p>Canned water, who would have thunk it. I stand corrected. I’d love to have a case full of that stuff! Rejean doesn’t like V8. The water in the can mixed in a bit with the V8, so it’s V8 tasting water.. or diluted V8, mmmm diluted V8.</p>

<time datetime="2003-01-12T14:47:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 12<span>th</span>, 2003</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome, kids, to Lynie’s School for Clueless Boyfriends. I know that some of you don’t know why you’re here, but let’s, for a minute at least, forget about those restraints around your wrists and ankles and listen to what the teacher has to say for today, shall we? It isn’t like you have much of a choice, anyway.</p>

<p>Today’s lesson is called “Jewelry: A Gold-Digger’s Best Friend”. Most of you have, at one time or another, been confronted by your S.O. (significant other)–if you’re married we’ll say I.O. (insignificant other)–about why you never buy her jewelry and if you don’t smarten up soon, “[she’ll] darn go and find a husband who will”. Don’t buy the hype, kids; it’s all a crock of shit. If, when she makes a ostentatious statement like that, you choose to cave in to her demands because you’re a wuss and can’t stand up for yourself, you’ll find your restraints tightened until your extremities turn blue or you get a clue and kick her sorry ass to the curb. You’re a man, right? It’s about time you made known your position in this relationship.</p>

<p>Now, teacher isn’t trying to devaluate her own gender with this lesson, she’s merely shelling facts that high-maintenance girlfriends who are all about the jewelry aren’t in love with you, but just your monetary value and her materialistic tastes. Miss Lynie wants to see these girls get what they deserve: a big kick in the bum and slaps across the face until they get some sense knocked into them.</p>

<p>If you are involved with a girl like that [“I pity the fool”–Mister T.] I have a few tips to give you to gradually turn her into a carefree, loving girlfriend who’ll actually appreciate you for who you are and might–you never know–be very giving in the, uh, bedroom department <em>cough cough</em>. Stranger things have happened.</p>

<p>Okay, so, she has a birthday coming up and has asked for a cute charm bracelet? Buy her a tool belt instead. Wipe that confused look off your face and listen to the mistress! In an indirect sense, tool belts are the same as charm bracelets. H.M.G. (high-maintenance girlfriend) can wear it, add metallic objects to it, and she can proudly show it off to all her carpentry friends (the ones you found at the bar and paid $10 each to come home with you and meet the missus, along with a lifetime supply of electro-shock therapy to sooth the pain of the sound of H.M.G.’s obnoxious voice. Shut up, you know how she is).</p>

<p>After your 6-month stay in the I.C.U. and the expiration date of your restraining order has passed, you can resume your loving gift-giving extravaganza because now that you’re crippled, no girl will ever love you as much as M.M.G. (mid-maintenance girlfriend. While you were away, she had some time to think about the gift you gave her and has started to soften up. Also, one of her carpentry friends gave her a coupon for a session that he couldn’t attend because he had some mafia business to take care of. I don’t know. Just know that her intelligent level, as high as it was before [sic] has dropped a few dozen.) does.</p>

<p>Make your way to the hardware store–careful, that motorized wheelchair is a bitch to get out of ditches–and start purchasing electrical tools. She knows what it feels like to get electrocuted, so now she’s ready for the big leagues. Your best bet would be to get her a Dremmel tool; then she can cut, polish, sharpen, carve, chisel, engrave both your initials in her skin so you’ll be bonded forever and EVER, oh and did I mention it cuts? Yes? Okay then. I’m as forgetful as the commercial, it seems.</p>

<p>Once all the silverware in a 10-mile radius has been polished clean and everybody in town starts walking around with sunglasses and white sticks and a few people have fallen and they can’t get up (HELLO run-on sentence!), your girlfriend will go up to you and ask you if it’s nearing Christmas (by golly, yes! It’s only 3 weeks away) all innocently and wonders if you’d buy her a new tool. Then–and only then–will you know that you’ve been successful at turning a H.M.G. into a L.M.G. (low-maintenance gal). Congratulations!</p>

<p>Now I know that this isn’t an easy process to accomplish and that’s why I’ve compiled a list of things to say if she ever resists (and you know she will! She is, after all, a woman and that’s what women do).</p>

<p>When she says: “If you loved me you’d buy me diamond earrings” you reply: “and if YOU loved ME you’d give me more blow jobs than Michael Jackson gets nose jobs” (they’re both jobs! Hee, I made a funny.)</p>

<p>When she says: “(insert irritating gossipy friend’s name here) got a pearl necklace from her sick excuse of a husband (that’s what you’re thinking because if he married that hag, he’s not much of a man, is he?) for their anniversary” you say “if I bought you jewelry people wouldn’t pay attention to your beautiful face anymore. You don’t want that now, do you?” (flattery always works, boys)</p>

<p>When you buy her her first tool you’ll undoubtedly be met with a look of disgust and she’ll spit at you “what am I supposed to do with this?” you can say “start by fixing your attitude and then go and make me some shelves, while you’re at it.” Just make sure you’re wearing an armor suit when you say that or else you’ll be the next John Wayne Bobbit.</p>

<p>At least HE’S getting some now.</p>
