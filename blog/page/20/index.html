<p>Look farmiliar?</p>

<p>For those of you who frequent Al @ Freddy&rsquo;s site, you&rsquo;ll know he&rsquo;s in the process of revamping it. He&rsquo;s switching to MovableType .. the best blogging software out there.. it&rsquo;s the best Jerry, the best! (I&rsquo;ll stop beating that Seinfeld line with a dead horse .. and a stick .. ??? .. or whatever.) Everyone needs to start watching Wonderfalls, I&rsquo;ve been quoted saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best show that&rsquo;s come out of Fox since That 70s Show, in my opinion!&rdquo; Alot of the cast is Canadian, and it takes place in Canada, though some people are debating that, the store is clearly on this side of Niagra Falls. This is my latest playlist, I call it &ldquo;wayback&rdquo;:</p>

<p><img src="http://greener.sdf1.org/blog/archives/waybacklist.jpg" alt="waybacklist.jpg" /></p>

<p>Ah yes, the 80s, the time of Rubik&rsquo;s cubes, the peak of the Hungry Hungry Hippo craze (comprised of Henry, Harry, Homer and Happy Hippo) and when ABBA started sucking (some will argure that they always sucked, but I disagree, you bastards) More <a href="http://www.inthe80s.com/">80s</a> here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s also the most entries I&rsquo;ve had in one month since February 2003, yay for me. Next month is April .. duh .. it also happens to be this blog&rsquo;s 4 year anniversary. I&rsquo;m thinking of beating that first month&rsquo;s record of 86 entries. Since there aren&rsquo;t 86 days in April, I&rsquo;ll have to either call up Mr. JULIAN ROBERT HUNTE and ask him to change the calendar, or post more than 1 entry per day.. a shit.. I just remembered, I lost the guy&rsquo;s number.. I&rsquo;ll just post a couple per day.</p>

<p>The plan today is eat, hopfully go out eat since there isn&rsquo;t any food here and then go do groceries, because there isn&rsquo;t any food here.</p>

<p>Did you know: &ldquo;Saltwater fish drink water because their bodies are saltier than their environments so they lose water by osmosis, for freshwater fish, the opposite is true, so they don&rsquo;t drink.&rdquo; Now you do.</p>

<p>(Chorus)
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
We try to take it slow
But we&rsquo;re still losin control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I&rsquo;m craaazzzy
for tryin to be yo laaadddy
I think I&rsquo;m goin crazy
Girl, me and you were just fine (you know)
We wine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love (you know)
Walks on the beach and stuff (you know)
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo
, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That&rsquo;s why I flew you out
When we was on tour
But then something got out of hand
You start yellin when I would bring friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons (bull shit)
You know I have to make them dividends (bull shit)
How could you trust our private lives girl
That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t believe my lies
And quick to say
[Chorus]
Why does emotion gotta move so fast
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin it slow
So why does it got to be so damn tough
Cuz fools in lust could never get enough of love
Showin the love that you be givin
Changing up your livin
For a lovin transistion
Girl it&rsquo;s a misson tryin to get you to listen
You! Mad at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin
“Who the hell?!?”
Who the hell?
What the hell&rsquo;s going down?
Too much of the bickering
Kill it with the sound and
[Chorus]
Girl our love is dyin
Why can&rsquo;t you stop tryin
I never been a quitah
But I do deserve betta
Believe me I will do bad
Let&rsquo;s forget the past
And let&rsquo;s start this new plan
Why? Cuz it&rsquo;s the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you&rsquo;re tired of the things they say
You&rsquo;re damn right
Cuz I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No it ain&rsquo;t
it was a different thing
No it ain&rsquo;t
it was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you&rsquo;re usless
whhoooaaaa
(Chorus)
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up <a href="no%20ooooo%20uh%20uh">3x</a>
Shut it up, just shut up
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up [3x]boy no now please go, no i don&rsquo;t know
Shut it up, just shut up(nooooooooooooo)
Stop the talking baby
Or I start walking babyx13 on 4th (ooonnnoooooowooooo)
Is that all there is x12 starting from 5th</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gary didn&rsquo;t coax me into anything, I brought it upon myself. 3 pitchers.. can you confirm that Gary? What a fun night though. Rik wasn&rsquo;t there, so Colepaugh was on bass .. and sometimes on harmonica .. like on Norwegian Wood .. ya, das right. When Neil went on stage and got boring, we headed over to Paramount to see Steve LeBlanc, the guy kicks ass, simple as that. I saw Marc Dupuis, though I thought he was his brother.. they look so much alike. I was really drunk at the time, so he must think I&rsquo;m a complete idiot.. .. but I wasn&rsquo;t as drunk as I am now .. haha .. joke yink .. not.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how I got to the car, but I remember everything after dropping off Gary.. I remember getting out of the car and plopping down in a snowbank and staring at the sky.. an den.. puking in some parking lot.. an den.. (insert emotional breakdown description here).</p>

<p>There will be no next time Lynie. Without divulging too many details .. hah .. I can&rsquo;t say anything actually .. ask me about it sometime. Oh and you had a coma and I had a strawberry shortcake .. mmmm.</p>

<p>Moe .. chepas la, Calgary is pretty far .. but it&rsquo;s only for a short period of time, and it&rsquo;s CALGARY, I mean .. CMON! (that means go for it)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Friday:</p>

<p>Woke up to the sound of the buzzer around 18:00. Nic came by to start off our night of heavy drinking. So I got ready and off to Pump House we go. Our first table was not &ldquo;boot worthy&rdquo;, way too high. We settled for a normal table where we could drink our boots in comfort. We both ordered a boot. Both blueberry, his had blueberries, mine did not. They&rsquo;re not allowed to give 2 boots to one table, because they only have 2 boots. We both got a boot, without getting 2 separate tables. ~2 hours later, we have a VERY good buzz. We headed over to my place to settle down a bit; watched the latest Survivor. On to .. another bar to drink .. we diecided on VooDoo. Get there, pretty much dead, but people slowly showed up. We had a few martinis and a few other drinks. (I lost count after a while). Monique joined us later on, yay, I had a dancing partner. After VooDoo we went on to Big Stop. I ordered a Day&#8217;n&#8217;Ross, but barely ate it. Got back, stayed up, don&rsquo;t remember what I did. Slept on and off till 19:30.</p>

<p>Saturday:</p>

<p>Woke up, ate the Day&#8217;n&#8217;Ross. Went back to bed. Woke up, drank water, went back to bed. This went a a few more times. Finally got out of bed around 20:00, got ready to go to O2 .. on a mission. Mission failed. Had a shot with Lynie, the high point of the night :) Went home early, got Smart Pizza. Went to bed at 3:00.</p>

<p>Sunday:</p>

<p>Pretty much slept thru Sunday. Woke up here and there and watched TV shows I downloaded. Sunday was &ldquo;lethargic day&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Present:</p>

<p>Woke up at 1:00. At work, the coffee I had with breakfast at Jean&rsquo;s with Al is wearing off, I&rsquo;m going to need a Tim&rsquo;s soon. Plan for tonight is Doc&rsquo;s with Gary and Al. I&rsquo;m going to be tired, high on caffeine .. the alcohol is going to have quite an effect. I just hope Gary doesn&rsquo;t coax me into getting the same number of pitchers as the last time we went to Doc&rsquo;s. Ouff. Btw, this post has comments enabled. Post away. Not all the templates are updated, so stuff might not look very nice. I&rsquo;m working on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow night Nic and I are going out drinking. He says he&rsquo;ll be starting off with a boot, looks like I&rsquo;m going to have to do the same. Blueberry, hold the blueberries, thanks.</p>

<p>My laptop is still in the shop, I&rsquo;ve been living off of Al&rsquo;s laptop, using pine on sdf for my mail and the official MSN client on Durandal (Al&rsquo;s powerbook G4) since he uses aMSN, both can run at the same time. I&rsquo;ve been doing ALL my surfing at work. I&rsquo;m pissed that I lost all my old emails .. I had some stuff in there I REALLY wanted to save. Ah well, what am I supposed to do. Faget-a-abat-it. (I watched Donnie Brasco yesterday).</p>

<p>I should be getting paid in 5 hours. Supposed to be the 15th, but since it&rsquo;s a Monday, they have to deposit the money early .. that&rsquo;s how it is with me .. not the case for some co-workers. I better get paid, I need to get the car checked, it&rsquo;s been making noises, I think the distributor is messed up.</p>

<p>Got the new Resurgo today, interesting stuff will be upgraded this summer, such as Centennial Park, Victoria Park .. Vaughan Harvey extention the the bridge .. Assomption phase 2 (adding 3-4 more side streets south of Main St. and more park area and flowers and residential areas and stuff) and of course the Riverfront Park boardwalk phase 5.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m going to spend the last hour of work I have typing here.</p>

<p>Tonight I&rsquo;d like to go to Doc&rsquo;s for jam night, haven&rsquo;t been there in a couple weeks. I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m going to call someone whom I&rsquo;m supposed to call to do something ;) Chris&#8217; gf/fiance is in Moncton, I&rsquo;m hoping he&rsquo;ll bring her there so I can meet her, if he&rsquo;s playing. I&rsquo;m also hoping <a href="http://www.colepaugh.com/">Colepaugh</a> will be there. It doesn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s playing anywere, &lsquo;cept South By SouthWest next week. I&rsquo;m almost done reading The Demon-Haunted World .. next up will be something by David Suzuki.</p>

<p>My title is reference to the almost empty 21 oz. cup I have sitting on the desk. It used to filled up, brimming with Mountain Dew. Alas, I drank it all. I had a chicken sub garnished with green peppers, pickles and cucumbers .. a little mayo .. salt and pepper. It was pretty good .. for a sub. SubWay on Main St. is open 24hrs .. that&rsquo;s great when you work crazy ass shifts like 19:30-7:30.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m listening to ABBA .. hehe, just for fun, I wanted to know how many times I&rsquo;ve mentioned ABBA in my blog .. 3 times .. I think that&rsquo;s 3 times too many for alot of you.. well, 4 now. There&rsquo;s something about that music that I like.. my Mom used to listen to ABBA when I was young, and in the womb, I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s imprinted on my neural pathways.</p>

<p>Speaking of music, I need to get more jazz. a few months back I watched The Comedian .. it&rsquo;s basically Jerry Seinfeld trying to become a stand-up comedian again, anyway, the soundtrack is great, full of jazz. I&rsquo;ve got most of the songs from it, including one of my new favorite tunes.. Waters of March sung by Suzannah McCorkle. I could listen to that song and her voice forever.</p>

<p>Which reminds me..</p>

<p>I lost all my tunes .. and all my old emails .. and other things I&rsquo;ll eventually find out about. I got some stuff off the HD before it died .. but not my Library folder .. the one folder that&rsquo;s really important. I&rsquo;ve got pictures and documents and stuff.. so ALL is not lost.. but alot is. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can get the dead drive spinning again.. at least long enough to get data off of it. I&rsquo;ll be bringing it in in a couple hours, for the third time. It pains me to say it, but I&rsquo;ve brought an Apple product in 3 times to get fixed, hasn&rsquo;t cost me a thing, but it&rsquo;s an inconvenience for sure. My next laptop is going to be a tank, a 12&#8221; PowerBook G4.</p>

<p>Still 30 minutes left, and I&rsquo;ve run out of things to say, as usual. Ohhhh.. a song I haven&rsquo;t heard in a while .. The Bad Touch .. see <a href="http://greener.sdf1.org/blog/archives/000206.html">this</a> entry for the lyrics. Here&rsquo;s an idea.. I&rsquo;ll post a picture of something..</p>

<p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DP9YxkcKuKo/Tn0P6v3q0uI/AAAAAAAAALY/IGWVPMvjAlA/s320/monkey.jpg" alt="monkey.jpg" /></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve had this site for 4 years .. and this is the first time I post a picture of a monkey. Wow.</p>
