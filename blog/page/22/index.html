  <div class="entry-content"><p>Holy crap I’m messed up in my weekends.. I thought this was Monique weekend.. but duh.. it’s valentines day (yuk). 2 weeks.. that’s a long time to wait.</p>

<p>Friken valentine’s day. I don’t capitalize it, because I don’t like it one bit. I don’t even know if it needs to be capitalized, if it does.. then screw you valentine’s day!</p>

<p>Remi logged on MSN today, talked to him for a bit, it had been a while. Damn I’d like to go visit.</p>

<p>Well, now that I’m free Saturday, what to do what to do. I know there will be alcohol involved, to both celebrate AND .. um .. not celebrate.</p>

<p>I feel like going into one of those “type just for the hell of it” kind of rants, like I used to do. There only one problem, I’m asking myself the same question I always ask in this situation: what to type? I could talk about the white B-691 Hi-Fi Sound Monitor speakers that are directly in front of me, but that’s not interesting, at all, nope. How about I talk about how there’s 202 jobs in the queue waiting to be printed.. I just need to wait for those E0B2Q jobs to finish so I can fianlly switch 9004 to bkhol and get rid of a big chunk of those jobs. Naaa.. again, not very interesting.. even for people who know what I’m talking about. Work talk is boring, and generally bad. I hate work talk, specially call center work talk. “I had this one person who kept yelling at me and blah blah blah” I understand it’s necessary to let it all out so as to relieve stress and such, but please, don’t talk to me about it. I’ve had my fair share of calls from hell, I think I can honestly say I’ve heard it all. I’d rather not hear it again, it just brings back memories that I’ve subconciously selectively repressed. Hooo look at that queue go down .. sorry .. work talk.</p>

<p>I missed Friends, Survivor and The Apprentice tonight, I’ll start downloading them as soon as I get home, hopfully they’ll finish by the time I wake up. I watched American Idol on Friday and Monady I think.. I kinda got interested.. but I’m not downloading the ones I’m missing.. dunno why, I don’t care much I guess. I desperately need a haircut, and I need to get my car looked at, I think I’ll stay up today and take a nap this afternoon. I also need to do laundry, geez, so much to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been doing alot of blog reading tonight, thought I’d post for good measure. Kinda like karma, ya know.</p>

<p>So I’m at work, babysitting printers, that’s what I do on night shift, I babysit printers…. OMG LOL “my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard” .. on the radio .. hoo, okay, calm toi la. Nope can’t resist, “j’ai d’quoi dans mes shorts”, hah.. okay.. as I was saying, right, I babysit printers. THey blink when they need to be fed (paper), they blink when they puke (paperjams), they need to be burbed when they’re full (too many pages in the outbut bin). I hate this job.</p>

<p>My iPod battery died about 2 hours ago, that’s why I’m listening to the radio .. actually not at this precise moment, the volume is turned down so I can hear the repetetive sounds of 5 printers printing in unison. I’m going mad.</p>

<p>Can’t wait for Saturday, going out with Moe, we’re going to paint the town .. some color that will represent our drunken state. I’m also looking forward to spending time with Gary before I go out dancing (if you call my body movements dancing).</p>

<p>I bought an <a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight</a> (damn, I said that already), really cool, I’m never calling Gary on a conventional phone again. It so fun! Hihi!</p>

<p>I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a>, like Nic says, it doesn’t have much dialogue, but it makes up for it in the visuals and the acting. It reminded me of American Beatuy, how silent moments can convey so much.</p>

<p>Oh, and I found my flashlight (for those who didn’t know, I had lost my flashlight)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Time for an update, I’ve been neglecting this place, even if I have plenty of time to update. There isn’t much new, Joker moved in with me .. I’m still single .. I still work at the same place .. I still don’t know anything about the job .. borrrring.</p>

<p>I bought Sopranos season 4, watch it, can’t wait for season 5 to start. Other shows I’m watching:</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Smallville
Survivor All Stars
The Apprentice
Enterprise
That 70s Show
Curb Your Enthusiasm
The O.C. (of course, I’m addicted)
Friends</p>

<p>I was also watching Carnivale, but thats over, can’t wait for that to start again, wow, what a cliff hanger.</p>

<p>I’m reading Carl Sagan’s The Demon-Haunted World .. awesome book if you embrace science.</p>

<p>Went to Cosmo/Oxygen with Monique Saturday, holy crap we had fun! I talked like I was schoolgirl .. and danced like I was a schoolgirl.</p>

<p>Superbowl night with Nic, Gary and Brad .. and Doris the Keg. Great time, good food, good beer, borg boob.</p>

<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.utilikilt.com/catalog-mocker-index.htm">Utilikilt</a>, I can’t wait to wear it, I <em>WILL</em> wear it in winter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s really early, I’m in bed listening to ABBA. I did nothing tonight, except watch the latest Enterprise episode and Conan. Speaking of TV shows.. I started watching The O.C.; I’m totally addicted to that show. There’s something about it’s soap opera’ish qualities that just sucked me in. Fucking Oliver Trast, I despise him!</p>

<p>I bought Glade plug-ins refils, they smell really nice, my bedroom door is open and I can barely smell it.. very tropical, <em>snifff</em> ahhhhhh.</p>

<p>Damn I’m boring.</p>

<p>I climb the walls of my mind just like I’m climbing on a jungle gym
I am more than content with the
state of mind I am in
‘cause I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.
I don’t think I need a rubber room,
but hey, that might be nice
I’m not a manic depressive paranoid or schizophrenic so I don’t need your advice.
I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.
The lights are on but nobody’s home
my elevator doesn’t go to the top
I’m not playing with a full deck
I’ve lost my marbles
The lights are on but nobody’s home
my elevator doesn’t go to the top
I’m not playing with a full deck
I’ve lost my marbles.
I’m a few bricks short of a load,
but a full load always hurt my back.
I flew over the cuckoo’s nest and
I’m never ever coming back because
I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.
I am crazy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, that’s still on on CBC. I remember watching it every Sunday night when I was young. Lion King is the feature tonight. I haven’t seen that in a while. “They call meeee, MISTER PIG!!”</p>

<p>New Years was great! Oxygen with Monique, Ned and Ryan. I met someone I hadn’t spoken to in 6 years. Looks like we might be speaking more in the near future ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So.. Monique and I decided to drink tonight (mention goes to Denis, her boyfriend, and Ryan, Denis’ friend, since they were there) .. Monique said the only reason she reads my site is because I (used to) mention her. So.. this post is all Monique.</p>

<p>Like.. when we went to VooDoo meeting Lyne and Jeanot.. then quite by accident, we meet Colin.. yay.. I wasn’t in the greatest of moods, but I started drinking (because of Monique) and eventually I was in a mood enough to go dancing, like club dancing, like bump and grind dancing .. yeah.. das right Ned. I remember one drink from that night.. the uppercut. Orange juice and .. something else that was good and that you put into an alabama slammer.</p>

<p>And that other time we went walking in THE (70cms) snow storm, Monique met me at my door all drenched in snow, we walked in search of a movie to watch. We were on the corner of King and Main and we met an interesting fellow who told us the Rogers was closed, he suggest some convenience store on St George.. we get there and we’ve seen all the movies (I’ve seen all the movies, anyway). So Monique buys a Claude’s Poutine can and gets gipped thru interac (yes, it’s possible, ask Monique). We eat that.. great cooking btw :) And Monique starts dipping in the wine..</p>

<p>(edited for content)</p>

<p>..then I hid the spray bottle and continued cleaning the carpent of wine. Once I was sure that my personal safety was ensured, I finally kicked her ass at MKDD. Then left for home. Hihi.</p>

<p>Good times.. the only reason I don’t mention you is because not everyone wants to have every little detail posted on here, and subsequently on Google.. then the world. So, if you want.. I’ll start taking notes.. and post EVERY little detail, I’m not being sarcastic.. I WILL take notes :D. btw.. new Album du Peuple. Narapu!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello, my first post <a href="http://picker.greener.ca">Picker</a> post. If you live under a rock, I did something with that 6100 Nic gave me, it’s now a message board. Feel free to sign up and join in the kookiness. I’m listening to Sarah McLachlan (I always have to look up her last name on google for the correct spelling, very sad). I’m feeling a little nostalgic, even melancholic these days. I digress for now, but I’m going to have to do something about that.</p>

<p>Snow, yes, we’ve had alot of snow. 70cms people say. I refer you to <a href="http://picker.greener.ca/viewtopic.php?t=15">this</a> post. Scroll down, that’s my car.</p>

<p>Well it’s getting early, time for bed. S’ouaira.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Holy crap.. I was bored tonight so I decide to go to Cosmo, like I usually do. Alone. Seems like Rev has a new flavor, called Red. So I have a few drinks, Keith’s (2 for one before 11), then I decide to dip into the Rev, the new one. So I’m standing there right. Waiting to get served.. the bartender comes up and asks what I want, I say, “a Rev, the new one”. There’s a cute girl next to me, so I get chatting. The bartender passes me my drink, and the girl says, “you’re drinking Rev?”, I say “ya!”.. she says “a guy should not drink Rev” and goes on explaining that she would never hook up with a guy who drinks Rev.. I’m .. kinda offended.. I say, “there are laws in Canada that say that I can drink whatever I want” .. and she leaves. Bla bla bla.. I sit at their table (it’s hard to compress everyhting that happened in one little paragraph) and we go dancing.. last call is called, the music stops, and I get to find out who this girl is.. from Cocagne.. yes.. and she knows who Sebastien and all of them are.. this sets me back.. obviously.. and all I can think of is.. .. Cocagne REALLY is the center of the Universe.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is .. if you want your life to get exciting, quick, drink Rev.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The NBTel tower has been renamed to the Aliant tower. It only makes sense since they replaced the NBTel logos with Aliant ones a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Alot of people have been asking me “what’s new these days?”, and all I can answer is “absolutely nothing”. It’s true, there’s just no news these days. Of course.. even if ther’d be news, I usually answer “nothing” to that question anyway.</p>

<p>I worked nights all weekend, next week is my short week, and I’m hoping to make “plans”. I need to get off my ass, look passed my timidness and do something with her.</p>

<p>I watched “The Elegant Universe”, a NOVA special that was on PBS a few weeks ago, I downloaded it thru one of my “not so legal” websites.. but the show itself has been released for download by PBS, so there was nothing illegal about it. Let me just say the show rocked. Great basic overview of string theory.. or M theory. It flies in the face of everything I learned in high school, but it looks promising, almost makes me want to go back to university and study physics. Thank you Moose for mentioning the show, I never would have picked it out.</p>
