out. went home. oh, here&rsquo;s an idea, i an use my re light emmitting diode to light up my wycwhile i type in the dark. let me try it&hellip;awsome it works.. very well actually. now i&rsquo;m not forced to use the power consuming backlight. if i take the bus tomorrow, i hope i have the car, i&rsquo;ll surely write something. i can wait to go camping with this. i&rsquo;ll be able to take logs and notes and stuff.. awesome. i must go for the windfish awaits, goodnight_</p>

<p>My friend Al is having problems with elevators. I think he pressed the wrong button, or doesn&rsquo;t know how to operate one. Fireball whiskey, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

<p>I have come to a conclusion, there are no pictures of Fireball Whiskey on the internet. After an extensive search, I could find no pictures.

Now that I have rechargeables&hellip; well.. if I go on I&rsquo;d be repeating myself.. read up later on today. .. or.. forget this sentence if there&rsquo;s something on top.. actually.. you would have read it alr&hellip; oh NEVERMIND!</p>

<p>something i just noticed.. my last palm entry had a time that was not properly formatted. not good. i&rsquo;m going to fix it.. by now you won&rsquo;t see it anymore. again, just as last night, i&rsquo;m waiting for my electric blanket to warm up. it is. i&rsquo;m not capitalising my words because its too time consuming. i just got a warning, my batteries are going to die, so i turned the backlight off and turned on the lamp.. i mean the lamp on the table next to my bed. battery seems fine now. i looked for software that would allow me to update with mr. palm here, but i couldn&rsquo;t find any. i may think of maybe learning how to program something for it, what an accomplishment that would be. i better go to bed now.. hehe, im in bed.. i better go to sleep now. wow, just now i ran out of power, i think it&rsquo;s the backlight, it sucks power very badly.

Not only is there bordome below, but there&#8217; boredome on the sides too, it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;side boredome&rdquo;.

I need to buy 4 AAA rechargeable batteries and a AAA rechargeable battery charger. Gonna do that tomorrow, it&rsquo;s for my <a href="http://www.palm.com/products/palmiiie/index.html">Palm IIIe</a>. I think I have allergies, something I&rsquo;ve never had before. Just recently my sinuses have been clogging up, and I&rsquo;ve been sneezing more. Intresting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms just say the word, and they are yours
Just help yourself to the love,
In my heart your smile has opened up the door
The greatest wealth that exists in the world,
Could never buy what I can give
Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms, and then lets really start to live
Allllllllll right. Yeah&rdquo;</p>
