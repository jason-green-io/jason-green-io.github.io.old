<p>continued from <a href="http://www.blogger.com/11.html">yesterday</a>, then i changed the posters for tomorrow, met michelle, basically on my way
out. went home. oh, here&rsquo;s an idea, i an use my re light emmitting diode to light up my wycwhile i type in the dark. let me try it&hellip;awsome it works.. very well actually. now i&rsquo;m not forced to use the power consuming backlight. if i take the bus tomorrow, i hope i have the car, i&rsquo;ll surely write something. i can wait to go camping with this. i&rsquo;ll be able to take logs and notes and stuff.. awesome. i must go for the windfish awaits, goodnight_</p>

<p><strong>10:44</strong></p>

<p>My friend Al is having problems with elevators. I think he pressed the wrong button, or doesn&rsquo;t know how to operate one. Fireball whiskey, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

<p><strong>11:20</strong></p>

<p>I have come to a conclusion, there are no pictures of Fireball Whiskey on the internet. After an extensive search, I could find no pictures. I guess I have no math class, that&rsquo;s a good thing. An idiot in my class decided he steal a urinal saop thing an put it in class. Now it stinks, so no class.</p>

this is becoming a ritual. writing in bed. i find it easier here. i&rsquo;m going to attempt to tell you all exactly what i did at work tonight. i got to crystal palace at around 17:35 with a bag of burger king food containing a large fry and a chicken sandwich, no cheese or bacon. i ate that and then put up the cinema checklists. i turned the lobby screen on. then i helped mitch with the deliveries. after that i selected posters i want and put them in a safe place. after that i did door. when people stopped comming in i put up all the new postrs we got: hollow man, rocky and bullwinkle, big mammas house, boys and girls and loser. then i went on break. came back from break, did checks, talked a bit to jeff. swept the main lobby. did door, saw stephanie. i shall contine tomorrow.

<p>something i just noticed.. my last palm entry had a time that was not properly formatted. not good. i&rsquo;m going to fix it.. by now you won&rsquo;t see it anymore. again, just as last night, i&rsquo;m waiting for my electric blanket to warm up. it is. i&rsquo;m not capitalising my words because its too time consuming. i just got a warning, my batteries are going to die, so i turned the backlight off and turned on the lamp.. i mean the lamp on the table next to my bed. battery seems fine now. i looked for software that would allow me to update with mr. palm here, but i couldn&rsquo;t find any. i may think of maybe learning how to program something for it, what an accomplishment that would be. i better go to bed now.. hehe, im in bed.. i better go to sleep now. wow, just now i ran out of power, i think it&rsquo;s the backlight, it sucks power very badly.

Now that I have rechargeables&hellip; well.. if I go on I&rsquo;d be repeating myself.. read up later on today. .. or.. forget this sentence if there&rsquo;s something on top.. actually.. you would have read it alr&hellip; oh NEVERMIND!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms just say the word, and they are yours
Just help yourself to the love,
In my heart your smile has opened up the door
The greatest wealth that exists in the world,
Could never buy what I can give
Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms, and then lets really start to live
Allllllllll right. Yeah&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I skipped my first day. Some people are actually dissapointed. Hm. Very busy at CPC today/night. I sold a personal record number of tickets. With the price changes I was only 2 dollars off. Not bat at all. I still don&rsquo;t have Wayne&rsquo;s CD. I said I&rsquo;d bring it to him Monday, what am I to do, I think I&rsquo;ll just assassinate Chris. I&rsquo;m craving soup in a styrofoam cup. Mmmmm. Styro-soup. Yves came, and left, was great seeing him again. I got a cool AOL 5.0 coaster I&rsquo;m going to use to put my styro-soup on. I can&rsquo;t find a picture of styro-soup.</p>
