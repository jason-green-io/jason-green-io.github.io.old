  <div class="entry-content"><p>I forgot to mention, today is not officially my one (1) week anniversary with this “daily thing”.. kinda like 2000 is not the first year of the the millenium. Tomorrow, or actually, midnight tomorrow, which is in 13 hours. Now that I think of it.. it’ll be the time I started writing the first entry last Saturday.. which was… dunno.. but it was around 19:00. Al, start your page already, I’m tired of rereading my entries, and Lyne’s I know won’t change during the day. It’s time for:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Holy s*** I’m bored. (This page is rated general, for all audiences) I’m in hour 2 of electronics. Last hour I fell asleep. Wilbur, eh?, right. He always puts me to sleep. I got Pepsi and a Coffee Crisp, that should keep me awake till the afternoon, the time my brain usually wakes up.</p>

<p>“I’d like to share a revelation that I’ve had, during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you’re not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague, and we are the cure.”</p>

<p>I love that movie. Vin Vout Vin Vout. I’m gonna go mad. I can’t wait to get home and.. not be here. Course is done, here I go to type this in. (that last sentence doesn’t sound gammatically correct)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m sitting at home, in front of my computer with my Platypus. Let me explain. I’m a bit of a hiker, one piece of equipement I have is a hydration system (wacky name for a bag of water). The one I have is called a platypus because of the shape of the valve at the end of the pipe. Difficult to explain. Anyway.. I got it filled with water and I have the “platypus lips” in my mouth as I type. I love it. I can drink water without using my hands. I’m a bit tired, probally because of Cosmo. I have a good feeling I’ll be heading to bed early tonight. Oh yeah.. that reminds me.. I have stuff to do with my palm. There.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Scrap that, someone else gave me the answers.. not that I couldn’t get them myself, just too lazy. Whatever.. here’s an excellent quote I found:
“There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere.” - Isaac Asimov</p>

<p>I love it, got it here: <a href="http://www.quoteland.com/">quoteland.com</a>. Now I’m bored. Got nothing to until 1. I think I’ll just sit here and type. Don’t got anthing else to do. (I’m aware of the grammar in the last sentence.) I’m still reading quotes. I’m not going to post them though.. Some people reading would totally flip-out because I usually don’t quote Robert Frost or Johann Christian Friedrich von Schiller (yeah right, as if I read anything from that last one). No mail, sad, dissapointing. Tomorrow is my first week anniversary with this “daily thing”. I’m thinking of doing something special (said like the Church Lady). Woman Sues Nike Alleging Sneaker Made Her Fall ah hahahahahah! for 10 * 10^6 dollars! pfft. Ohhh.. the new full trailer for X-Men is out.. I’m getting it now, I’ll let you know what it’s like.. ooh.. and I can play it in full screen becasue I’m on a Pentium III.. ohh.. this should be good. Damn, I need to get Quicktime.. shouldn’t take long.. but it’ll take longer than what it would take me at home :).. sorry. Stupid download deamon. I hate those “here is a program that’s supposed to help you download stuff off the net”. I think they’re useless. Ok.. Got Quicktime, here goes. Ok.. it’s loading.. very slowly. I can believe that.. the file size must be 50 MB. I have to wait till it’s done downloading, I wouldn’t want to ruin the suprise. I always do that. If I’m downloading a trailer or something from a site that is kind of slow, I’ll start watching it knowing it’ll cut in the middle. I have to stop doing that. Still not done, I just though of something.. since this is the first dy the trailer is out.. chances are all those huge X-Men fans are probally all at their computers downloading it. That means they’re bropally bringing the whole server down.. which would explain why my transfer rate is slow! Ahha! I need headphones, all the computers in the lab have sound cards but no speakers. (I’ve always wondered what it would sound like in a lab with 50 computers with sound cards and 50 horny young male adults watching porn on them during class) Almost half done. I think I’m going to put a picture a day.. it’ll call it.. the picture of that day! Yeah! Or something that matched the name of this “daily thing”. If the text is from Ma Brain.. then.. a picture would be.. let me do a little reasearch.. I will call it..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m in class now.. in front of a computer, with a keyboard. Our instructor just handed us an assignment, yes! It’s an easy course, I’ll have it done before I leave college. Right! So.. Cosmo! I actually spent most of the time upstairs, which is totally unlike me. I danced, which is totally unlike me. The things alcohol does to your brain. I have to reboot the machine I’m on and go in DOS to finish the assignment.</p>
