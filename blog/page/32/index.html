  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a boring day, I didn&rsquo;t do squat and loved it. I woke up at 14:00 and watched National Lampoon&rsquo;s Van Wilder (that&rsquo;s why I wasn&rsquo;t online), a very funny film, if you like that kind of humor. It has one of the grossest scenes I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a movie. I then ate some of my mother&rsquo;s wonderful leftover Thanksgiving dinner. Then I watched Joe Somebody, another great movie with Tim Allen. During a short period where I was channel surfing, I decided I&rsquo;d watch the chronological version of Memento.. but not without snacks. I had a few in mind, Chunky Monkey ice cream and Harvest Cheddar Sun Chips.. I found the Sun Chips, but not the ice cream. I did however find chocolate milk.. nummy. It was a great drive and I learned a lot.. I learned the Sunday operating hours of every grocery store in Moncton. So now I&rsquo;m going to watch Boomtown, a new show that&rsquo;s apparently good, then Memento.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here we are again
and we&rsquo;re looking at each other as if each other were to blame.
You think you&rsquo;re so smart, but I&rsquo;ve seen you naked
and I&rsquo;ll probably see you naked again.
MillI Vanilli told you to Blame it On The Rain
but if you blame it on the rain tell me
what can be gained so, if all else fails you can blame it on me.</p>

<p>[Chorus]
If all else fails you can blame it on me.
If all else fails you can blame it on me.
If all else fails blame it on me.
If all else fails you can blame it on me.</p>

<p>Then you smile again
but you&rsquo;re looking at me as if there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m supposed to say.
Forgive me Father,
but I&rsquo;m falling in love and that&rsquo;s all I have for confession today.
Maybe if you&rsquo;d ask me on any other given day
I wouldn&rsquo;t have time for you or anything that you say
but it&rsquo;s alright now, you can blame it on me.</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>Yes dear I love you,
but sometimes I think that love&rsquo;s not enough for you.
So you want to play mind games,
well that&rsquo;s fine, go ahead, la la la I can&rsquo;t hear you.
Here you are
and you&rsquo;re a hundred thousand miles away;
They say that absence makes the heart grow fungus.
I wax poetic as you&rsquo;re waxing your legs,
you say you think there&rsquo;s a traitor among us.</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night (because it&rsquo;s morning now) Al R., Leo and I drove up to FP and watched The Transporter.. Lynie, you didn&rsquo;t miss anything. It sucked. Al wanted to see it because of the action sequences.. and I&rsquo;ll give him that, there were a few original, good action scenes, but the rest of the movie was just plain old bad. When we got back we played Trivial Pirsuit.. twas fun, Leo won, though we never finished the game, then Joker joined us and we played a real game.. 200. We played three rounds and Leo and I won 2. Making us the 200 champions, w00t w00t.</p>

<p>Leo went home at 2 and both Als and I went over to Joker&rsquo;s place and played Halo.. well, Joker and I played Halo, Al just fell asleep on the couch. We had a little multiplay action going on with jeeps blowing up and stuff, then we played the final level on Legendary, fun stuff. All in all it was a fun night.</p>

<p>Hey Pretty Baby With The
High Heels On
You Give Me Fever
Like I&rsquo;ve Never, Ever Known
You&rsquo;re Just A Product Of
Loveliness
I Like The Groove Of
Your Walk,
Your Talk, Your Dress
I Feel Your Fever
From Miles Around
I&rsquo;ll Pick You Up In My Car
And We&rsquo;ll Paint The Town
Just Kiss Me Baby
And Tell Me Twice
That You&rsquo;re The One For Me</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished Watching Memento, was on TMN, excellent film. I&rsquo;ve got it on DVD, but I was one of those people who bought it as soon as it came out, and didn&rsquo;t wait for the special edition. Now that the special edition is out, I&rsquo;m kicking myself in the ass. I might just buy the special edition anyway and try to sell the original to a poor unsuspecting shmoe. Is that how you spell shmoe? I dunno. Ohhh.. commercial for the Soprano&rsquo;s.. it&rsquo;s funny reading what I just typed.. I actually saw the &ldquo;r&rdquo; as a gun. I think I might buy that too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wonder if it&rsquo;d be worth it if I subscribe to Blogger Pro. I&rsquo;d have a bunch of extra features.. like posting in the future, and the past. .. Future might not be as useful as past.. I&rsquo;d be able to put all my old posts into blogger. It also allows me to post to my blog via email, dunno if I&rsquo;d use it, but it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m done reading my old posts, I&rsquo;ve learned a few things, noticed a few things.. very enlightning. I went thru and actually corrected a few code errors. I was listening to Bootylicious on the way to work. I am so bored. Gary is cleaning the print area, he&rsquo;s desperatly looking for stuff to put in the &ldquo;Shred-it&rdquo; recycling bin. I happen to be sitting right next to the print area. When the printer turns on, it&rsquo;s vents blow the refreshing smell of toner right in my face. It&rsquo;s wonderful. It&rsquo;s only been 2 hours!! 8 to go. I&rsquo;m looking forward to supper, I&rsquo;m very hungry.. I think I&rsquo;m going to go get something to eat.. like junk, and caffeine.There&hellip; Dr. Pepper, Cruncheez and a Coffee Crisp, everything a bored computer geek needs to satisfy his hunger.</p>

I can go back in the past and really see what I was up to, something I haven&rsquo;t really done until last morning. I&rsquo;m going to give this place a bit more importance, as in post more.</p>
