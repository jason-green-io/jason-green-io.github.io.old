  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m going to spend the last hour of work I have typing here.</p>

<p>Tonight I&rsquo;d like to go to Doc&rsquo;s for jam night, haven&rsquo;t been there in a couple weeks. I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m going to call someone whom I&rsquo;m supposed to call to do something ;) Chris&#8217; gf/fiance is in Moncton, I&rsquo;m hoping he&rsquo;ll bring her there so I can meet her, if he&rsquo;s playing. I&rsquo;m also hoping <a href="http://www.colepaugh.com/">Colepaugh</a> will be there. It doesn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s playing anywere, &lsquo;cept South By SouthWest next week. I&rsquo;m almost done reading The Demon-Haunted World .. next up will be something by David Suzuki.</p>

<p>My title is reference to the almost empty 21 oz. cup I have sitting on the desk. It used to filled up, brimming with Mountain Dew. Alas, I drank it all. I had a chicken sub garnished with green peppers, pickles and cucumbers .. a little mayo .. salt and pepper. It was pretty good .. for a sub. SubWay on Main St. is open 24hrs .. that&rsquo;s great when you work crazy ass shifts like 19:30-7:30.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m listening to ABBA .. hehe, just for fun, I wanted to know how many times I&rsquo;ve mentioned ABBA in my blog .. 3 times .. I think that&rsquo;s 3 times too many for alot of you.. well, 4 now. There&rsquo;s something about that music that I like.. my Mom used to listen to ABBA when I was young, and in the womb, I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s imprinted on my neural pathways.</p>

<p>Speaking of music, I need to get more jazz. a few months back I watched The Comedian .. it&rsquo;s basically Jerry Seinfeld trying to become a stand-up comedian again, anyway, the soundtrack is great, full of jazz. I&rsquo;ve got most of the songs from it, including one of my new favorite tunes.. Waters of March sung by Suzannah McCorkle. I could listen to that song and her voice forever.</p>

<p>Which reminds me..</p>

<p>I lost all my tunes .. and all my old emails .. and other things I&rsquo;ll eventually find out about. I got some stuff off the HD before it died .. but not my Library folder .. the one folder that&rsquo;s really important. I&rsquo;ve got pictures and documents and stuff.. so ALL is not lost.. but alot is. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can get the dead drive spinning again.. at least long enough to get data off of it. I&rsquo;ll be bringing it in in a couple hours, for the third time. It pains me to say it, but I&rsquo;ve brought an Apple product in 3 times to get fixed, hasn&rsquo;t cost me a thing, but it&rsquo;s an inconvenience for sure. My next laptop is going to be a tank, a 12&#8221; PowerBook G4.</p>

<p>Still 30 minutes left, and I&rsquo;ve run out of things to say, as usual. Ohhhh.. a song I haven&rsquo;t heard in a while .. The Bad Touch .. see <a href="http://greener.sdf1.org/blog/archives/000206.html">this</a> entry for the lyrics. Here&rsquo;s an idea.. I&rsquo;ll post a picture of something..</p>

<p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DP9YxkcKuKo/Tn0P6v3q0uI/AAAAAAAAALY/IGWVPMvjAlA/s320/monkey.jpg" alt="monkey.jpg" /></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve had this site for 4 years .. and this is the first time I post a picture of a monkey. Wow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sopranos season 5 premiered tonight, I was at work. Joker is nice enough to download and host the episode for me since my HD is dead. I&rsquo;ll be bringing my poor laptop into the shop today sometime. I&rsquo;d like to get the dead drive back, just to see if I can get data off of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Picker is up. For all you techies out there, here&rsquo;s a description of the problem. Picker uses mklinux to boot. So the hard drive is partitioned in 3, the HFS side for the Apple OS, swap and the main linux partition. So, to boot linux, it needs to boot part of the Mac OS, until it loads the extension, then the linux kernel takes over. What was hapenning is since it&rsquo;s had been so long it hadn&rsquo;t rebooted (because linux is such a kick ass OS) it wanted to check the hard drive. It usually runs fsck on boot, this time it wanted to do some kind of exaustive scan.. problem with that is that it always froze at 64.7%. It still does. So to get passed it, I booted up in Mac OS, changed the date so that it would think it didn&rsquo;t need to check the HD, then modified fstab so that it doesn&rsquo;t check the drive during startup (in case of power failures or whatever). So at this point, I still don&rsquo;t know why it freezes at 64.7%. It could be a bug, or it could be an actual HD problem. I&rsquo;ll be backing up the databases daily, just in case.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m hungry. I&rsquo;m torn between BK and Subway .. and since it&rsquo;s early, maybe even Smart Pizza. Speaking of Smart Pizza, they&rsquo;ve been handing out ALOT of those 5.00 off coupons .. so many that I see many of them littered everywhere on my way to work. Promotion is fine.. but geez, there&rsquo;s gotta be a better way that giving out flyers.. put a guy in a big monkey suit with a sign saying &ldquo;monkey says: 5.00 for 2 slices&rdquo;.. or something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First picker goes down due to hard drive problems, then there&rsquo;s the latest developments in my soap opera life .. now my iBook is dying due to hard drive problems. I&rsquo;m not upset or anything .. but it&rsquo;s a little unpleasant.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about picker, people hardly used it. I&rsquo;m not rushed to fix it, but I do want to fix it. My soap opera .. it&rsquo;s nice to be in one instead of watching for a change. Que sera, sera. I&rsquo;m brining my iBook in as soon as I&rsquo;m positive I have all my stuff backed up, or that it dies completely.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, it&rsquo;s official, I&rsquo;m never using IE again. Unless I need it at work to visit a crappy Microsoft biased site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Check this out, a second post in the same day. That hasn&rsquo;t happened in a long time. I kept working on the site this morning (8:00), added the colors and borders and stuff. I really like CSS.</p>

<p>Monique just called, it&rsquo;s a go for tonight, w00t! Going to have supper then .. drinking. When Ned comes down, he likes going to restaurants he doesn&rsquo;t have in Woodstock, mainly, BJ&rsquo;s and Sun Sun. Mmmmm.</p>

<p>I moved my phone charger to my room, since it makes more sense to have it there, when I go to bed, I can let it charge, and if it rings, I&rsquo;m right there, otherwise, it&rsquo;ll be in my pocket, fully charged, because the charger is in my room. .. so, yeah .. my phone charger.</p>

<p>I love the part of Live and Let Die by Paul McCartney when it picks up, then goes into some reggae, then back to the intense James Bond action scene score.</p>

<p>Tonight I&rsquo;m hopfully going out with Ned and Monique, Ned&rsquo;s in Moncton for spring break, or as I like to call it: ressort casse.</p>

<p>My work &ldquo;day&rdquo; is coming to an end. Print went very well tonight. Since we switched printers, we&rsquo;ve been getting less jams .. ! .. in fact, I didn&rsquo;t get a jam tonight! That has to be a first! I didn&rsquo;t get any papercuts either, but that&rsquo;s because my hands are used to them now, they&rsquo;ve developped a thik layer of paper resistant skin. .. or something.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to buy a car this spring; a 2004 Toyota Echo hatchback. Stop laughing, they&rsquo;re good cars.</p>

<p>Lost in a dream
Don&rsquo;t know which way to go
If you are all that you seem
Then baby I&rsquo;m moving way too slow
I&rsquo;ve been a fool before
Wouldn&rsquo;t like to get my love caught
In the slammin&#8217; door
How about some information&mdash;please
Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh
Or am I caught in a hit and run
Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh
Are you just having fun
Time&rsquo;s standing still
Waiting for some small clue
I keep getting chills
When I think your love is true
I&rsquo;ve been a fool before
Wouldn&rsquo;t like to get my love caught
In the slammin&#8217; door
How about some information&mdash;please
Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh
Or am I caught in a hit and run
Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh
Are you just having fun
You are so hard to read
You play hide and seek
With your true intentions
If you&rsquo;re only playing games
I&rsquo;ll just have to say&mdash;bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Do do you love me
Do do you love me
Do do you love me
Do do you love me
I&rsquo;ve been a fool before
Wouldn&rsquo;t like to get my love caught
In the slammin&#8217; door
Are you more than hot for me
Or am I a page in your history-book
I don&rsquo;t mean to make demands
But the word and the deed go hand in hand
How about some information&mdash;please
Chorus cont.
I&rsquo;ve been a fool before
Wouldn&rsquo;t like to get my love caught
In the slammin&#8217; door
Are you more than hot for me
Or am I a page in your history-book
I don&rsquo;t mean to make demands
But the word and the deed go hand in hand
How about some information&mdash;please

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Disclaimer: the thoughts expressed in this entry reflect a warped, inhebriated view of the world at the time</em></p>

<p>Well well well.. j&#8217;ai eu d&#8217;la fun d&#8217;souaire. It was Monique and I&rsquo;s night out. We went to the Four Ice Center to go skating, damn new skates really hurt my feet! It got bertter with time. We then headed to my place and drank and watched a few episodeds of That 70s Show. Next stop, Oxygen. I danced like I never danced before. For the first time, I&rsquo;m going to get personal here.. big leap. I saw people I always see at the bars, and I was able to stick it to them. Kristin and Beth. Last time I saw them, they kinda blew me off, cool people and all, but I find them a bit snobby sometimes. Anywho, they were there in the &ldquo;lobby&rdquo; between Paramount and Oxygen.. I said my hello&rsquo;s and left.. didn&rsquo;t stick around to talk, just left. It felt kinda good.. damn, Kristin still has my Run Lola Run.</p>

<p>Before gong to Oxygen, Al let me know that Isabelle and Kristy were actually there.. wow .. quite a coincidence. I saw them on the dance floor while dancing with Monique, but I avoided them, Al says they went out to get away from boys.. so I&rsquo;d didn&rsquo;t want to ruin that by going up and chatting it up. Eventually I caved and decided I wanted to go talk to Kristy, so I proceed to go upstairs .. before I even start up the stairs I see Isabelle, she&rsquo;s leaving, so I go over and ask her what&rsquo;s going on, she&rsquo;s leaving, wants to go see Al at my place, I tell it&rsquo;s all good, and I ask her where Krsity is, she&rsquo;s still there with friends.. alright.. that calms me down a bit and I vow to Monique to go over to Paramount and dance the rest of the night away.. .. time passes, I&rsquo;m on the floor with Monique at Paramount, breaking out my cool ass moves (pffft) .. tap on the shoulder, it&rsquo;s Kristy, wtf. Something like &ldquo;hi just wanted to say hi&rdquo; .. not too sure what she&rsquo;s thinking with me dancing with Monique (she has no idea who Monique is). I say something like &ldquo;hi, okay, ben s&#8217;ouaira plus tard&rdquo; .. wow, I have no idea what to think.. so I put it out of my mind and enjoyed the rest of the night. Isabelle is here right now sleeping, Al is working at 10:00, so I imagine I won&rsquo;t get to talk to her. The one thing that I can&rsquo;t get out of my mind is.. how did she know where to find me.. she might have told me when she tapped my shoulder, but I didn&rsquo;t hear.. chu toute confused. All in all, it was a very fun night!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Damn, right now, Toxic is playing on my internet radio station. I just got back from cosmo, good time, actually, I had a really good time, I talked to Ian alot, about his future plans and Family Guy :) I helped 4 cute girls from St John get a cab. They were really greattful.. they were a bunch of cool people.</p>

<p>Geez, I don&rsquo;t want to get anybody jealous.. if I did, I want to know right away, I&rsquo;m not used to posting stuff like this on my blog.. frig. Tonight started with supper from St. Hubert, take out style. Kristy, Isabelle, Al and I went to St Hubert to eat. Line was too long, so we decided to take take-out. Ate at my place.. then we played Monopoly, Kristy and Isabelle kicked our asses. Isabelle was the clear winner after Kristy forfeited :)</p>

<p>..</p>

<p>Then we played 200. I lost, as usual.. frig, now I need to get into the whole &ldquo;200 losing streak thing&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d rather not, but here it goes: during the past 3 weeks, Al and I have been partners playing card vs. Kristy and Isabelle. We&rsquo;ve lost both times&hellip; by.. alot. This time, teams were changed, Kristy and I vs. Al and Isabelle. I still lost, but by a smaller margin.. I&rsquo;m thinking I suck. No one wants to admit it, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m the root cause of my losing streak.</p>

<p>What else is new.. nothing except I got my kilt. Yes, a kilt. My utilikilt has arrived, I wear it anytime I can .. it&rsquo;s so comfy, it&rsquo;s hard to put on jeans now. I don&rsquo;t understand why it&rsquo;s socially acceptable for women to wear a skirt and men can only wear pants.. there are fundamental appendages that should automatically qualify us to wear an un-bifurcated garment. Damn you acceptable social behaviors and related clothing styles.</p>

<p>I digress.</p>

<p>Blah.</p>

<p>Damn I need to go to bed in case I&rsquo;m called to go to breakfast tomorrow. Oh, something else going on tomorrow.. SKating with Monique&hellip; and the long awaited drink/dancefest. Geez, tcheu journée.</p>

<p>Oh&hellip; dance version of Toxic .. I&rsquo;ll be hearing that alot in the future :D.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A joke I lol&#8217;ed at.</p>

<p><em>I was walking across a bridge one day, and I saw a man standing on the edge, about to jump off. So I ran over and said &ldquo;Stop! don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he said. I said, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s so much to live for!&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well&hellip; are you religious or atheist?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Religious.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Me too! Are you Christian or Buddhist?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Christian.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Me too! Are you Catholic or Protestant?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Protestant.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Me too! Are you Episcopalian or Baptist?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Baptist!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Wow! Me too! Are you Baptist Church of God or Baptist Church of the Lord?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Baptist Church of God!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Me too! Are you original Baptist Church of God, or are you reformed Baptist Church of God?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Reformed Baptist Church of God!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Me too! Are you Reformed Baptist Church of God, reformation of 1879, or Reformed Baptist Church of God, reformation of 1915?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Reformed Baptist Church of God, reformation of 1915!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Die, heretic scum&rdquo;, and pushed him off.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Holy crap I&rsquo;m messed up in my weekends.. I thought this was Monique weekend.. but duh.. it&rsquo;s valentines day (yuk). 2 weeks.. that&rsquo;s a long time to wait.</p>

<p>Friken valentine&rsquo;s day. I don&rsquo;t capitalize it, because I don&rsquo;t like it one bit. I don&rsquo;t even know if it needs to be capitalized, if it does.. then screw you valentine&rsquo;s day!</p>

<p>Remi logged on MSN today, talked to him for a bit, it had been a while. Damn I&rsquo;d like to go visit.</p>

<p>Well, now that I&rsquo;m free Saturday, what to do what to do. I know there will be alcohol involved, to both celebrate AND .. um .. not celebrate.</p>

<p>I feel like going into one of those &ldquo;type just for the hell of it&rdquo; kind of rants, like I used to do. There only one problem, I&rsquo;m asking myself the same question I always ask in this situation: what to type? I could talk about the white B-691 Hi-Fi Sound Monitor speakers that are directly in front of me, but that&rsquo;s not interesting, at all, nope. How about I talk about how there&rsquo;s 202 jobs in the queue waiting to be printed.. I just need to wait for those E0B2Q jobs to finish so I can fianlly switch 9004 to bkhol and get rid of a big chunk of those jobs. Naaa.. again, not very interesting.. even for people who know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Work talk is boring, and generally bad. I hate work talk, specially call center work talk. &ldquo;I had this one person who kept yelling at me and blah blah blah&rdquo; I understand it&rsquo;s necessary to let it all out so as to relieve stress and such, but please, don&rsquo;t talk to me about it. I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of calls from hell, I think I can honestly say I&rsquo;ve heard it all. I&rsquo;d rather not hear it again, it just brings back memories that I&rsquo;ve subconciously selectively repressed. Hooo look at that queue go down .. sorry .. work talk.</p>

<p>I missed Friends, Survivor and The Apprentice tonight, I&rsquo;ll start downloading them as soon as I get home, hopfully they&rsquo;ll finish by the time I wake up. I watched American Idol on Friday and Monady I think.. I kinda got interested.. but I&rsquo;m not downloading the ones I&rsquo;m missing.. dunno why, I don&rsquo;t care much I guess. I desperately need a haircut, and I need to get my car looked at, I think I&rsquo;ll stay up today and take a nap this afternoon. I also need to do laundry, geez, so much to do.</p>
