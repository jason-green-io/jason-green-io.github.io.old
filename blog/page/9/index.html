<p>Hi Caroline Leprince, sorry I put hanger pieces under your door.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching alot of Family Guy and American Dad lately, damn those are funny shows.</p>

<p>I finished reading The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene, what a great book, blew me away. I&rsquo;m gonna go wash my self and my clothes now.</p>

<p>Holy crap, I almost forgot, I saw Mama Mia a few weeks ago in Ottawa. It was my first musical .. damn it was cool. The story, the music the set .. everything was amazing. Everyone was dancing in their chairs. Check it out if you ever have the chance. (Mama Mia is a play based on the songs from ABBA, the second best band in the world.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Â comments are up and running again, sorry bout that, stupid permissions issue</p>

<p>Why hello there .. is anyone still out there? I&rsquo;ve got time to kill so I&rsquo;ll let you in on what I&rsquo;ve been doing for the past few weeks. I spent Canada Day in Ottawa with James and Leung-er, to guys on my course, we visited the new War Museum, Leung drove us up and went back, but James and I stayed in Ottawa for an adventure. Sam Roberts was playing on the hill, didn&rsquo;t get to see him much though, we spent most of the night drinking. We did find time to peel away from the bar to get a view of the fireworks, but immediately ran back to Darcy MacGee&rsquo;s so as to have a place to sit down after the festivities were over. When the bar closed, we took a cab to the bus station where a bus would drive us back to K-town at 10:30 in the a.m. The bus station closes at 04:30, so we had to hang out at a 24 hour McDonald&rsquo;s until the station opened. James got hassled by a few individuals thinking he was a skin head or something. The bus overheats in Kanata, delaying our arrival by 45 minutes. Here&rsquo;s some pictures taken by James.</p>

<p>On 9 July, Leung and I went to an air show in Schenectady NY. It was a cool trip there, never been in the Empire State before. We eventually made our way to Albany NY, capital of the Empire State. We toured the Crossgates Mall for a couple hours. We ate at Hooters. I visited the Apple Store. As you can see, I got to experience 2 of my favorite things, Macs and TnA. Here are pictures. (you&rsquo;ll be disappointed, no Hooters OR Apple stuff .. just an A-10 and an LC-130)</p>

<p>Last weekend I spent the weekend at Mac&rsquo;s cottage with Mac and Woodsy, on a lake. I &ldquo;learned&rdquo; to water-ski .. and I drank beer .. and got a wicked sun burn. Here are some pictures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a great time. Love it.. I remember back in the day listening to the live Sloan album in Al&rsquo;s basement.. we&rsquo;d listen to it at least once a week .. all the songs have been imprinted in my mind .. now imagine going to a concert and hearing all these songs kinda like for the first time.. but not, since you know them all .. wow. What a great stage presence .. just rocking out.. inciting you, teasing you. Then they switch it up, they can all play each others instruments .. wow. I have an infinite amount more of respect for them now that I&rsquo;ve seen them live.</p>

<p>I get my car today! Parents are visiting from back home, bringing the Trans-Canadamobile to K-town. I&rsquo;m gonna be free! Wow, imagine, being able to go anywhere you want anytime you want .. something I haven&rsquo;t experienced since January.</p>

<p>This update brought to you by Jack Daniels, the only thing that keeps the author sober and loose enough to type.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Eagles are so much cooler than I thought. Here&rsquo;s why: This conclusion only works if you&rsquo;ve seen Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy AND you like the twangy instrument called the &ldquo;banjo&rdquo;. Remember when the Earth gets destroyed .. and the camera pans down to reveal the actual Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy? Remember the tune that pretty much starts the movie? It&rsquo;s a song by The Eagles .. yes .. you can call them a country band .. but for some reason they released this crazy ass song called Journey of the Sorcerer on their One Of These Nights album. Get the song now, it&rsquo;s really cool. Buy it off iTunes music store .. yeah. The tune off of the soundtrack is a little bit different .. it&rsquo;s got more of a .. how do you say .. punch to it. The Eagles version seems to just stroll along.. but the movie version seems to have a place to go .. it just moves along faster. .. though it&rsquo;s a short version of the actual song.</p>

<p>SO what have I been up to? mmmm morse code.. lots and lots of morse code. wow.. amazing how much morse code I&rsquo;ve been doing .. I can&rsquo;t really put it into words .. well.. maybe I can .. 7:30-15:30, 5 days a week. I bought head phones today .. so I can &ldquo;copy morse&rdquo; better. You see.. I do what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;copying morse code&rdquo; which means listening to morse code at ridiculously high speeds and typing it out in Notepad. It&rsquo;s a very complicated procedure &ldquo;pfft&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll be doing this for 5 months .. been doing it for about a month now and I&rsquo;m at the brink of insanity. Have you ever been to the brink of insanity? A short description is: &ldquo;hearing patterns of short and long tones in every day life and interpreting them as demons trying to tell you to do bad things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This good ole entry has been brought to you by Jack Daniels, a proud sponsor of greener&rsquo;s sanity since .. Al introduced me to the Jack and Coke ages ago at Doc&rsquo;s .. back in &ldquo;The Coude&rdquo;. Expect more of them .. Jack does so much more than beer; therefore, greener will be drinking more of it (we&rsquo;re allowed storing alcohol in the &ldquo;shacks&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Hey, ya think I can type a little more here .. to compensate for the lack of updates? .. yeah I probably can .. currently listening to That&rsquo;s me Trying on Shatner&rsquo;s album. I like the whole album.. thank you Ryan. Congrats to Lyne and this Phil person on their new apt. Congrats Nic and Teri-Lee for getting married. Congrats Ned and Moe on getting the &ldquo;house&rdquo;. ouuuhh.. New Kids on the Block. That reminds me of last weekend, I went to the Grizz (it&rsquo;s basically a cougar bar), they played Step by Step.. I knew all the words and the young ladies were very impressed. I ended up talking to a french teacher from Mississauga named Brooke. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny if she&rsquo;d try to look herself up on google and stumble on this site? hah. I also bought an iron today .. what else have I bought since I&rsquo;m in Kingston .. high gain antennas for my Linksys router, a summer sleeping bag (which I sleep in every night .. it&rsquo;s what you do in the shacks), a binary watch (yeah.. it tells time in binary), t-shirts .. that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I went to Moncton for a split second.. sorry I didn&rsquo;t get to see everyone.. it was quite an adventure (also quite expensive). Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>

<p>My plan was to take the bus to Toronto at 6:30pm .. not knowing the bus actually leaves for Toronto at 6:30am .. the clerk at the bus station was nice enough to call VIA and see what they had leaving. I took the next train at 6:45pm or something like that.. luckily, the train station isn&rsquo;t too far from the bus station .. cab ride was something like 6 bucks. Get to Toronto around 9:00pm, start looking for a place to stay.. the Royal York is RIGHT THERE .. naa, there&rsquo;s got to be some other place (at this point I&rsquo;m starving). I checked out the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060202233548/http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/YYZBR">Renaissance</a> .. but the game was almost over, so I went back to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060202233548/http://www.fairmont.com/royalyork/">Royal York</a> and stayed there. Ate at the Armadillo Texas Grill .. good burger, good beer. Wake up at 7:00am, take the shuttle to Pearson International. Flight at 10:20am, land in Moncton at 1:20pm. Chill at the parents place for an hour then go out for a beer with Al at Doc&rsquo;s, which turns into supper at Sport&rsquo;s Rock. Then it&rsquo;s off to the bachelor party.. pick up Chris, head to Sussex, find the place no problem.. have a few drinks.. 11:30pm, time to head home. The car breaks down on the Trans-Canada 20 minutes away from the party. Get lift back to the party, end up going home at 3:00am. Wake up at 7:00am .. book a flight to Toronto from Halifax.. leave Halifax at 9:50am or something.. get into Toronto around 11:00am or something. Take the train to Kingston at 3:00pm or something.. then get home around 7:00pm. Whew. Total time travelling > total time in Moncton. It was fun though.. I really like travelling.</p>
