  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went to Vancouver/Victoria last weekend .. damn I love those rocky mountains.</p>

<p>We stopped at a McDonalds for breakfast and I overheard someone ask her father: &ldquo;Quosse tu veut dans ton café?&rdquo;. I had to ask: &ldquo;Yousse tu d&#8217;viens?&rdquo; .. The father answers: &ldquo;Shediac!&rdquo; What a coincidence .. of all the places and all the people in the country we actually run into someone from Shediac. Doesn&rsquo;t end there &hellip; stay tuned.</p>

<p>On the way up I saw alot of cars stalled on the side of the road, with coolant leaking everwhere. I think it was due to the scorching heat and the massive inclines.</p>

<p>We stayed at the Fairmont Vancouver, nice hotel if you like expensive luxury. Saturday we visited Stanley Park .. very very nice, trees growing over trees, beaches, flowers and stuff. Walked along the waterfront, ya des beaux &ldquo;boat&rdquo; là. Visited Gastown and Chinatown, had supper then retired to the hotel for drinks.</p>

<p>Sunday we got up early and took a bus/ferry to Victoria .. now there&rsquo;s a nice place to visit, stayed at the Fairmont Empress. Weather was very nice, lots of tourists.</p>

<p>We walk into an It Store kind of place on Government St. .. guess who walks up and says hi .. the people from Shediac! Twice in the same weekend .. they weren&rsquo;t even planning on going to Victoria! Craziness.</p>

<p>So now we&rsquo;re back in Calgary, we have another trip planned for next weekend, then we head back home, with a few stops along the way. Waterloo for sure. We&rsquo;ll be home to greet Yves, worry pas! We might even see him on the way back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry for the lack of posts, I&rsquo;ve been a bit busy.</p>

<p>So after Sault Ste Marie we went to Dryden, ON, AKA Bum Fuck No Where, ON. What a hole in the ground, the whole town relies on a mill, if the mill closes, the town becomes a ghost town .. there&rsquo;s alot of them around there. We stayed there 1 day and hung out with Ned&rsquo;s uncle.</p>

<p>Next stop, Regina .. but before Regina, we had lunch in Winnipeg .. I like how their peripheral highway works, kinda like Wheeler in Moncton. Trees seem to end a few minutes before Winnipeg, then after Winnipeg .. flatness .. lots and lots and lots and lots of flatness. You know how people tell you that the prairies are flat? Well .. they&rsquo;re more that just flat .. they&rsquo;re REALLY flat. Regina was cool, very nice clean city, we ate a very nice pub called McNally&rsquo;s, owned by the people who make Big Rock beer .. that&rsquo;s a western Canada beer company .. good beer.</p>

<p>Then it was off to Calgary, after Regina it gets a little less flat, tiny hills and the highway actually turns. When you get to Calgary, if the sky is clear, you can see the mountains, very cool sight. We didn&rsquo;t have any problems finding Monique&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>Monique&rsquo;s place: pink carpet in the bathroom, 3 shades of brown carpet in the kitchen, religious and family pictures hung on the walls .. it&rsquo;s like stepping in to a museum dedicated to the pinnacle of house design in the 70s. Alot of things are puke green and puke yellow. The floor we&rsquo;re living on is usually rented out to people, it&rsquo;s where and old lady used to live and has until recently been put in a home .. so this lady&rsquo;s crazy daughters show up when they want to pick up the mail .. quite odd. They&rsquo;re crazy.</p>

<p>Back to Calgary, Iove their transit system, very advanced.. they have a number you can call that will tell you when the next bus will come by at any stop in the city. We&rsquo;ve been to the Stampeed, it&rsquo;s basically a really big fair with rodeos and chuckwagon races and other things hicks do. One good thing about it is the concerts, we&rsquo;ve seen Sum 41, The Tea Party and Fefe Dobson&rsquo;s last song of her 1 hour puny set. Today we saw laser floyd, tomorrow (thought it&rsquo;s technically today now) we&rsquo;re seeing The Trews and Saturday is Nelly Furtado. I&rsquo;m having a great time. I plan on visiting Edmonton .. the West Edmonton Mall .. and we have a trip planned to visit Vancouver. Banff and Jasper will get visits as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just got back from a showing of Spider Man 2 in Sault Sainte-Marie, fucking teens were kicking and talking during the entire movie, I am very not impressed.. the theatre chain (Galaxy, a division of Cineplex Odeon) apparently doesn&rsquo;t have procedures to have users check the theatre periodically .. so they talked during the whole movie .. movie was awesome .. experience was the worst I ever had..</p>

<p>oh yeah .. the trip .. got to Ottawa 07/01 around 8:30 local time, was cool, crappy Tom Cochran was playing on &ldquo;the Hill&rdquo;, pretty fireworks, ate at Yesterday&rsquo;s. Caro&rsquo;s hospitality was equal to none. in 5 hours we head to Dryden.</p>

<p>Ontario has the wierdest passing lanes, you know, the one that let you pass trucks on hills .. instead of having the left lane end, they have the right lane end .. so you have to switch lanes even though it tells you to &ldquo;stay right except to pass&rdquo; .. and Quebec sucks, I hate the province, roads are aweful, you can tell when you enter Ontario.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blogging on the road, Ned and I are currently just outside of Levis QC, we&rsquo;re heading into what seems like a thunderstorm, w00t! It&rsquo;s a big one, one bolt every few seconds. The weather on the way up was really nice, when we hit Rivière du Loup it kinda got warm and muggy .. that&rsquo;s probally why there&rsquo;s a thunderstorm .. d&#8217;oh, we&rsquo;re not going in it, oh well, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be more on the way. Montreal is 235 KM away. Oh wait, scratch that, we will be going into one of them, seems there&rsquo;s a alot of them. Woohoo, lots of rain and lightning and stuff!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow, Ned and I leave on our cross Canada road trip. Here are our planned stops.</p>

<p>Ottawa, Sault Saint Marie, Dryden, Regina and Calgary</p>

<p>I had to get the car fixed before we leave .. our plan was to leave today, but the car took longer than I had anticipated. It needed: a new head gasket, head needed to be planed, valve job and oil change, total cost .. alot. We&rsquo;re good to go, runs like a new car.</p>

<p>I bought a 75W power inverter for the cigarette plug in the car so we can use the laptop or iPod continuously for tunes, which we&rsquo;ll need alot of.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is what I hear and how my testing went.</p>

<p>Next time the trade MIGHT open up is in September, if I&rsquo;m moderately high on the waiting list, there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;ll get offered a job .. unless they decide to cut back on recruiting in that trade .. there would have been a chance to send my file for selection tomorrow, they have opennings for the trade right now, but because my file is brand new, and there&rsquo;s alot of stuff left to do with it, there was no way to make it in time, so I&rsquo;m aiming for September .. barring unforseen difficulties, my file should be ready way before then. I passed everything except one of the parts of the physical fitness test, the push-ups .. needed to do 19 in a row, was only able to do 14 .. so I need to practice and retry. I can reschedule anytime, meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll be doing alot of push ups in my spare time.</p>

<p>So all is left is a second try of the PT test and then wait till September. I was told my results on the aptitude test do allow me to apply for the ATIS Tech trade .. which is one of the hardest to get into. Damn I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I talked to my friendly neighborhood recruiter, and he says I&rsquo;m set to do all the testing stuff on Wednesday .. that means physical fitness test, aptitude test, medical examination and interview. If I complete all 4 successfully, that means I&rsquo;ll be offered a position with the Canadian Forces. So that&rsquo;s the news .. what&rsquo;s new with you?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I gave my application to a recruiting officer Monday, I was missing a few things, so I had to fill out a few more forms and get transcripts for my college marks. If all ends are tied (missing stuff faxed to Fredericton) by Friday, there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;d start my testing and medical stuff the 23-24. Once that&rsquo;s done, I wait for a conditional offer.</p>

<p>Other than that, I&rsquo;ve been doing some hockey watching, lots of drinking, some frisbee playing, movie watching, got a wisdom tooth pulled, eye exam .. that&rsquo;s pretty much covers it.</p>

<p>Went to Cosmo, listened to Norm for a while then went dancing with Danielle and Christine. Then went to Smart Pizza and listened to some guy called Jeremie play guitar .. right there, at Smart Pizza.. pretty cool stuff. Then I got home and watched Shrek 2, wow, what a funny movie, my favorite part is near the end &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a rea &hellip; d&#8217;ahhhhhhhhh&rdquo; .. poor Pinocchio.</p>

<p>I got my &ldquo;The Cheat&rdquo; t-shirt .. The Cheat rock rocks on!</p>
