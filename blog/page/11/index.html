  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight started off as a normal &ldquo;I want to go downtown because I haven&rsquo;t been in such a long time&rdquo; kind of night. So I drove all the way down Elmwood, onto Donald, down Church and parked in front of St. James Gate. Mullet Monday&rsquo;s .. it&rsquo;s been a staple in my life ever since Monday&rsquo;s at Doc&rsquo;s died. Sadly, Paramount was closed.. no mullets. So, for a split second I decided to go to Doc&rsquo;s .. because it&rsquo;s Monday.. but wait.. Monday&rsquo;s at Doc&rsquo;s is dead.. so I go to St. James Gate.. the new home of Rik and Brendan. Walk in, greeted by a familiar face, Wayne. &ldquo;Hey, how&rsquo;s it goin&#8217;, gimme a Guiness.&rdquo; At this point I&rsquo;m not too happy about the whole no mullets thing. Moe&rsquo;s the drummer.. alright.. this is cool, Rik is there.. so is Brendan .. alright this is shaping up to be a good night.. Chris!!! woohoo Chris is here!!! They start with a Neil Young tune.. Brendan can&rsquo;t sing.. what? throat surgury.. that&rsquo;s too bad.. so who picks up the slack? Chris.. woohoo. the next 7 songs are all Beatles. wow.. just .. wow. I got to watch Chris sing Here Comes The Sun, Norwegian Wood, and A Day In The Life .. probably more. Ch&#8217;te dit, pas mal cool. Talked to Moe (Mau-rice) and Chris, he explained what he&rsquo;s aiming for with all the acoustic shows he&rsquo;s been doing lately .. go-go gadget Neil Young. Tonight&rsquo;s expectations were blown away. Still wondering why Paramount was closed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been one week and one day since my last entry. Highlights of my week include:</p>

<p>  *</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Johnny Talk-Talk
*</p></li>
<li><p>hiking a section of the Dobson with new friend Renée. We discovered an old secion of the trail that was blocked off because of presumably flooding.. walked it anyway. On our way back we met up with two (I think) barred owls. Quite a sight.
*</p></li>
<li><p>bowling with Eric, Shelley and Ned, scored a measly 140 something.
*</p></li>
<li><p>Barnyard and drunken golf/Halo/card playing with the boys.
*</p></li>
<li><p>Halifax with Renée, her sister and sister&rsquo;s husband, IMAX Harry Potter, supper at Il Mercato Ritorante and stimulating conversation all the way back to Shediac Bridge.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s hard to top these days, may next week be as fulfilling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s a relaxed Saturday afternoon here in Irishtown. I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll be seeing Team America tonight.. then head to the Player&rsquo;s Lounge and see Doyle work his magic. Freddy Al is supposed to come down for that, I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ll see him there.. wasn&rsquo;t able to coordinate with him cuz he hasn&rsquo;t been online all day. I&rsquo;m eagerly waiting for Enterprise episode 1 season 4 to finish. Last season finished with a twisted cliffhanger.</p>

<p>Here are pictures of my new room:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the viewers I have left, here is a new entry!</p>

<p>What I have been up to:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for a call from the Canadaian Forces, I&rsquo;m done my part of the application, (yup, did my push ups), now I get to play the waiting game! Yay! I moved.. I am now a &ldquo;trailer park&rdquo; resident. I like the new place, far from downtown.. means I&rsquo;ll most likely spend less cash on expensive bar beer. I&rsquo;m pretty much a slob, I don&rsquo;t do anything during the day, not enough cash to do anything.. I need to pay off the last bills, rent, movers.. then I&rsquo;ll be comfortable. Mat bought Donkey Konga, don&rsquo;t start playing, you wont be able to stop. When he&rsquo;s at work, I steal it from his room and play for hours on end.</p>

<p>Other than that news.. that&rsquo;s about it. I went hiking a couple times with a new friend, did most of the Coastal then a week later got &ldquo;lost&rdquo; (we knew exactly where we were at all times, no really.. we did) around Hayward Pinnacle.. that was lots of fun! Got my first EI cheque.. putting the rest of my crap in storage today (meaning Monday).. it should have been out by the 30th.. but the damn moving company never returned my calls.. the landlord said it was okay.. no one is moving in yet.. but it still needs to be rushed. I hate moving.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve fixed my commenting system, version 3.0 of movabletype allows for comment registration.. so if you want to post on here, you&rsquo;ll have to take a minute or 2 and creat a typekey login.. it&rsquo;ll work with any movabletype installations that use typekey. I noticed lately I started getting spam comments.. hence the lockdown.</p>

<p>If I forgot anything important in September.. let me know, my memory sucks.. that&rsquo;s why I have this site thingy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Listening to Rhiannon, watched the Mets game tonight, was a good game till Moncton lost. Turns out Ned was doing titles, pretty damn cool. Tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to 5 Islands in NS with the family, should be fun. Al moved out, I&rsquo;m alone for September then I move in with Kingpat and M@t, that&rsquo;s going to be a blast .. I&rsquo;m not a gamer now, but living with Mat will surely convert me .. he&rsquo;s hardcore.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing nothing these days, staying inside, watching TV. One day Ned and I played frisbee .. oh, and there was the Colt 45 party with Yves, that was fun .. and the Monoxides concert .. I think my hearing is forever depleted since that night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have returned, I&rsquo;ll continue where I left off in the last post so you can see the progression on how I got back here.</p>

<p>Hung out with Remi in Kananaskis, got crazy drunk, twice. Played golf in the Rockies. Met up with Acadians who just finished touring Nepal and Thailand</p>

<p>Weekend after the Vancouver trip we went on our other trip. Started in Banff, visited all the gift shops in Banff, visited the Banff Springs Hotel, then off to Lake Louise. I stuck my hand in Lake Louise, water is cold there. Visited the Chateau Lake Louise, visited all the gift shops in there. Rode a gondola up a mountain, was able to see Lake Louise thru all the smoke from the BC fires. Off to Jasper, almost hit a baby grizzly bear, saw mountain goats and elk on the way. Stayed at the Jasper Park Lodge, played frisbee, had ice delivered, drank beer. Off to Edmonton, didn&rsquo;t really go in town, just <em>the Mall</em>. It&rsquo;s big, really big.</p>

<p>Few days rest.</p>

<p>Headed back east. Drove in prairie mud (which is still on my car). Bought breakfast in Drumheller, slept in Saskatoon, checked out the Fringe Festival. On to Dryden, slept at Ned&rsquo;s Uncle Louis&#8217; place. On to Sault Sainte Marie, kinda got lost, found the hotel, ate SubWay. On to Waterloo. Crashed at Lou and his roomates&#8217; place for 3 nights. Drank beer in stubbies, had drinks at the Flying Dog, got crazy drunk. Next night, played frisbee and played pool at Dooley&rsquo;s with Yves, got crazy drunk. Drove Yves back to London, visited Toronto. Much Music, Sam&rsquo;s, CN Tower. Watched Garden State (go see it). On to Woodstock. Drove thru Toronto on the 401 to Montreal. Got stuck in Montreal rush hour traffic. Got to Woodstock, drank till 6am. Next day, ate some Wally&rsquo;s, off to Moncton. Brought Ryan and Jamie, had drinks at Doc&rsquo;s with Shelley and Eric. Next day, off to Prince Edward Island, had drinks at Jamie&rsquo;s friends&#8217; place, then off to Bubba&rsquo;s, then 42nd Street Lounge, then China Garden, where I got heckled by a waitress and punched in the arm by a girl. Off to Moncton again. Saw 1755 in Bouctouche with Gary, the show was sold out but we were able to buy tickets from minors who got carded, haha, suckers.</p>

<p>That brings me to this afternoon, where I&rsquo;m sitting in my housecoat writing this entry.</p>

<p>Boune Fête des Acadiens!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We went to Vancouver/Victoria last weekend .. damn I love those rocky mountains.</p>

<p>We stopped at a McDonalds for breakfast and I overheard someone ask her father: &ldquo;Quosse tu veut dans ton café?&rdquo;. I had to ask: &ldquo;Yousse tu d&#8217;viens?&rdquo; .. The father answers: &ldquo;Shediac!&rdquo; What a coincidence .. of all the places and all the people in the country we actually run into someone from Shediac. Doesn&rsquo;t end there &hellip; stay tuned.</p>

<p>On the way up I saw alot of cars stalled on the side of the road, with coolant leaking everwhere. I think it was due to the scorching heat and the massive inclines.</p>

<p>We stayed at the Fairmont Vancouver, nice hotel if you like expensive luxury. Saturday we visited Stanley Park .. very very nice, trees growing over trees, beaches, flowers and stuff. Walked along the waterfront, ya des beaux &ldquo;boat&rdquo; là. Visited Gastown and Chinatown, had supper then retired to the hotel for drinks.</p>

<p>Sunday we got up early and took a bus/ferry to Victoria .. now there&rsquo;s a nice place to visit, stayed at the Fairmont Empress. Weather was very nice, lots of tourists.</p>

<p>We walk into an It Store kind of place on Government St. .. guess who walks up and says hi .. the people from Shediac! Twice in the same weekend .. they weren&rsquo;t even planning on going to Victoria! Craziness.</p>

<p>So now we&rsquo;re back in Calgary, we have another trip planned for next weekend, then we head back home, with a few stops along the way. Waterloo for sure. We&rsquo;ll be home to greet Yves, worry pas! We might even see him on the way back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry for the lack of posts, I&rsquo;ve been a bit busy.</p>

<p>So after Sault Ste Marie we went to Dryden, ON, AKA Bum Fuck No Where, ON. What a hole in the ground, the whole town relies on a mill, if the mill closes, the town becomes a ghost town .. there&rsquo;s alot of them around there. We stayed there 1 day and hung out with Ned&rsquo;s uncle.</p>

<p>Next stop, Regina .. but before Regina, we had lunch in Winnipeg .. I like how their peripheral highway works, kinda like Wheeler in Moncton. Trees seem to end a few minutes before Winnipeg, then after Winnipeg .. flatness .. lots and lots and lots and lots of flatness. You know how people tell you that the prairies are flat? Well .. they&rsquo;re more that just flat .. they&rsquo;re REALLY flat. Regina was cool, very nice clean city, we ate a very nice pub called McNally&rsquo;s, owned by the people who make Big Rock beer .. that&rsquo;s a western Canada beer company .. good beer.</p>

<p>Then it was off to Calgary, after Regina it gets a little less flat, tiny hills and the highway actually turns. When you get to Calgary, if the sky is clear, you can see the mountains, very cool sight. We didn&rsquo;t have any problems finding Monique&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>Monique&rsquo;s place: pink carpet in the bathroom, 3 shades of brown carpet in the kitchen, religious and family pictures hung on the walls .. it&rsquo;s like stepping in to a museum dedicated to the pinnacle of house design in the 70s. Alot of things are puke green and puke yellow. The floor we&rsquo;re living on is usually rented out to people, it&rsquo;s where and old lady used to live and has until recently been put in a home .. so this lady&rsquo;s crazy daughters show up when they want to pick up the mail .. quite odd. They&rsquo;re crazy.</p>

<p>Back to Calgary, Iove their transit system, very advanced.. they have a number you can call that will tell you when the next bus will come by at any stop in the city. We&rsquo;ve been to the Stampeed, it&rsquo;s basically a really big fair with rodeos and chuckwagon races and other things hicks do. One good thing about it is the concerts, we&rsquo;ve seen Sum 41, The Tea Party and Fefe Dobson&rsquo;s last song of her 1 hour puny set. Today we saw laser floyd, tomorrow (thought it&rsquo;s technically today now) we&rsquo;re seeing The Trews and Saturday is Nelly Furtado. I&rsquo;m having a great time. I plan on visiting Edmonton .. the West Edmonton Mall .. and we have a trip planned to visit Vancouver. Banff and Jasper will get visits as well.</p>
