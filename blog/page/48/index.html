<p>“Life is the Universe’s tendency to create patterns accidentally.”</p>

<p>Good luck, it’s a hard one. So I got alot of sleep last, and I’m very happy about that. I changed the way the page works, you shouldn’t notice, but I sure the hell did.. I had to rename.. ALL the files.. and move them all around in different directories… oh and edit all the files too, forgot to mention that. If you find anything wrong, let me know. I’m watchin Alien Nation.. very good show. Wow.. that was a shocker.. I won’t get into it.. the reason I was mentioning it is because the Aliens (a ship of slaves landed something like 20 years ago and now they’re part of our society) have a wierd replication system, the female keeps the “pod” and the males go thru the same pains as the female. Even the male children of the family. Very odd. I’m kinda hungry, ate a box of KD, but I’m still Hungary.</p>

<p>Hey,
I’m not a lumberjack or a fur trader,
and I don’t live in an igloo or eat blubber or own a dogslead,
and I don’t know Jimmy, Sally or Suzy from Canada,
although I’m certain they’re really really nice.
I have a Prime Minister not a President.
I speak English and French, not American,
and I pronounce it a-bout not a-boot.
I can proudly sew my country’s flag on my backpack.
I believe in peacekeeping not policing, diversity not assimilation,
and that the beaver is a truly proud and noble animal.
A tuque is a hat, a chesterfield IS a couch,
and it’s pronounced zed, not zee, ZED.
Canada is the second largest land mass,
the first nation of hockey,
and the BEST part of North America.</p>

<p>My name is Joe, and I AM CANADIAN!</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The best CANADIAN commercial ever.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hehe,, see that.. 22:22.. cool. So I just got back from work. Fun day, Candace and I played hacky sack in box office for most of the day. even while we were serving tickets. Oh .. I gotta talk about last night. I had so much fun. Rick and Brendan were playing at Kramer’s Corner (Brendan Furlotte kicks ass for those who don’t know him.. and I think he kicks ass for those who don’t know me) Al and I got a pitcher of draft and just hung out in the stairwell going up to Kramer’s. I think it was his last gig in Moncton, he’s gonna tour North America with <a href="http://www.colepaugh.com/">Chris Colepaugh and the Cosmic Crew</a>. He played kick ass stuff.. Al and I got ourselves another pitcher and we had a good time. Then Ned, Remi and the bachelor party.. party arrived! Woo!! We said our goodbyes to Brendan and then eventually landed here.. at my pad. Al and I kept drinking and talking, what a blast! Played 31. It’s a card game.. like blackjack, but not. So that’s last night. I’m eating Jalapeno Humpty Dumpty potato chips. Yum, they’re very good. Sorry about yesterday’s entry, I know it wasn’t very long.. but hey! I’m the boss.. not that I think you think I’m not.. I’m just saying. Seems Caro is having computer trouble.. HAHAHAHA!! Sorry. I’m listening to Brendan as we speak now.. ah.. I love it. Geez.. I don’t know what to do right now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What an action packed night. Went to the mall today, I think I want to buy a digital camera, and a DVD player.. and I want to own property on the moon. It’s Un-cover on Much.. kick ass.. they play songs covered by other artists. Very cool. The world is being invaded by Mouseketters. Britney Spears, 2 guys in n’Sync, Kerri Russell. We need to increase our defences. Planet Britney is on!! Woohoo!! Sorry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Happy birthday Remi, happy birthday Remi, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy brithday Remi. Just doesn’t sound the same.. when typing it on a keyboard. Tonight, we’re rocking the house.. the Pump House to be more precise. I had a Pepsi this morning, but it had no effect on me. I’m still tired. In class today we experimented with paper airplanes. I got a “supposed” record breaking design, but we couldn’t get it work.. well. I haven’t eaten. I’m debating if I should go to electronics class, it’s starting in 15 minutes.. but it’s Wilbur… eh? right? I might fall asleep, again. Mmmm.. I think I’m going to try and download my ICQ database from home and install ICQ.. ask Al if he has eaten, or wants to eat.. if he’s online. Go, or not to go. Hmmm.. I don’t think I’m going to go. Almost done getting ICQ working. This can’t be.. looks like NO ONE is online.. not even the 4 people on my list who never turn their computers with Vibe off.. oh.. nevermind.. one of them is online… 2.. nevermind, it’s working.. sorry. Al, go online. Oh well. I’m taking off, heading to someplace with food, going to eat, something with grease.</p>

Make a floppy bootable. Create various directory structures. Make a file called “MYFILE.TXT” with a hidden attribute with name inside. That’s it. Jeff is next to me reading the page and refreshing while I update.. it’s fun too see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m in math class right now. Again, will be transfering this to digital format in an hour or so. Get Real was pretty good last night. I would have liked to see the other episodes instead of the season finale first. Got Pepsi again, it’s a ritual now. Coincidence? Some guy (Derrick) is singing the theme song to Degrassi Junior High. Second time I hear it in 3 days, after it’s absence of my auditory system for more than 4 years. Weird stuff is going on this week. Just met Mike, the pilot. He’s trying to get scheduled to fly in the twin engine, but no such luck. I offered to pay my way sometime to get a ride with him. I love flying, I don’t do it enough. I think I’m going to buy a helicopter. My mother is supposed to get her big check today, I wonder if she can lend me 3*10^3 $. iMac… Time for a sip of my Pepsi. If I was in a band I would like it to be called The Indefinite Integrals. This pen kicks ass. My father has crappy hand wirtting, I noticed something about mine, it’s crappy too. I brought my walkman to college today, and all my mix tapes -1, Warmnfuzzy Beatles. I’m not sure I’m going to even have a chance to use it. I only want to use it when I’m alone, because I find people listening to walkmans in public to be a bit anti-social on their part. I dunno. Kinda like crossing your arms when talking to someone. Hi Jeff if you’re reading this. This is begining to be a bit long. I never write for this length of time. It’s wierd. I’m on my second page, this is amazing! Well.. amazing for.. me, maybe not for you. I’m stopping now.</p>
