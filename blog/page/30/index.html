  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m in bed trying to fall asleep. I was very tired today because of lack of sleep in the past 4 days. I’ve finally recovered, but now I can’t fall asleep. Not a big problem.. at least I’ll get sleep. Ned and Monique were down for the holidays, them, Al and I went to Right Spot to see CCCC, they rocked the house down, very awesome. I danced for the most part of the night. then yesterday Ned and I saw Two Towers, my third time, what can I say, I ove the movie.</p>

<p>“When I go out, well I know I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be the man who’s goes along with you.”</p>

<p>Today is the ex-CPC staff party. Woohoo, I’m actually kinda excited! Been looking forward to it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Horray for the holidays. I received a large amount of Future Shop gift certificates. I’ll most likely be buying a digital camera, very soon. I’m at work, brought my laptop in case it was REALLY dead, but it’s not.. so I’m not doing much with it. Can’t wait for the snow to come, I hope we get alot more than they’re forecasting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Damn nag screens are back. I shouldn’t complain.. I shouldn’t even talk about it. Currently listening to Voulez Vous.. ABBA.. sweeet. Offer still stands for anyone who would like to post on my blog.. enough with the blog.. I’m pretty sure anyone reading this is annoyed by all the fuss I’ve been making with the redesign.. I know.. it’s so insignificant it’s not even funny. But it entertained me, and I had fun with the whole technical part of it.</p>

<p>You know what.. I think this calls for a celebration… I’m going to crack open a beer. Tsssst .. clink clink.. damn. Friday night and nothing to do. I’m working at 7:30 tomorrow, perhaps it’s for the best. I’m on the day shift again, ouff, way too early for me. Time flew by between 7:30 and 12:30.. that’s one good perk about the shift.</p>

<p>Paragraph break for no reason.. ahh remember those? I’m going to have a new years resolution this year.. some “fans” might be glad to hear it, I’m going to try and post everyday in 2003. Quite a challenge.. we’ll see how I do. I’m also looking forward to making multi spanning entries with numbered parts like everyone else. Ahhhhh… America.. Simon and Garfunkel.. sigh.. .. sip.</p>

<p>I got a haircut today. I’m all ready for “les fêtes”. I just discoved accents on my keyboard.. for those of you in OS X, and using English as your keyboard layout, open up Keycaps in Applications/Utilities .. now press “option” and see the white highlited keys.. if you press those with “option” then a letter, you get the proper accent.. kîck ãss.</p>

<p>Last Saturday I went to Wal-Mart to buy Shampoo, a toothbrush and double-sided tape. When I got to the checkout counters I said “fùck dät” .. lines were WAY too long. Well.. I got the toothbrush today.. at Wal-Mart.. line wasn’t that long. I found a big bottle of shampoo in my cupboard.. so I didn’t need to buy any. It’s really cheap shampoo.. bulk Costco type.. (yes, costco, I know you’re not suprised Lyne) it does the job.</p>

<p>no an den!</p>

<p>no an den!</p>

<p>no an den!</p>

<p>okay.. that was so you know what the an den means.. if you still didn’t get it see: Dude Where’s My Car. Not quite sure what to do with this section. It’s stuff that doesn’t appear on the index page right away, you have to click it. Hmmm.. I could put quotes and stuff so that they don’t over stretch the index page.. or if the entry is really long, I could cut part of it and put it in here.. oh the possibilities.</p>

<p>I’ll also be looking into putting a search bar somewhere so you’ll be able to search for all my previous posts. That could be interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m cancelling blogger pro! I’m using movable type, and it’s the bestest thing ever. This is my first official post with it.. as you can see, I’ve had alot of test posts. Just to let you know what’s new.. I can now add titles to my entries.. yay, no big deal. Comments, you can tell me how stupid I am.. or mock my spelling and point out my typos. That’s about it. New to me is reliability, more flexible templates, kick ass user interface and much much more. One more thing.. if you see “do you want to know more?” it means the post is extended, meaning there’s more if you click the link. If you have any suggestions, find anything broken, leave a comment or drop me an email.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>more entries, damn blogger is broken, it won’t let me import all my posts in movable type.. this entry will be in the past by the time I get everything up and running. damn blogger.. okay I’m going to typw alot because I want to test the height of the box.. what happens if I reach the end, will it add scroll bars? maybe not.. maybe I’ll have the select the text and scroll up by movine the cursor.. that would suck.. I can’t see how a polished peice of software like movable type would use something like that.. well.. we’ll see I guess.. I’m almost there, more that half way.. more than a third now.. I saw Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers on midnight yesterday, it rocked, I’m seeing it again tonight with Al, Joe and Leo and Al C. .. and whoever else is going. “My precious” Gollum rocked.. he was awesome. Ok.. I’m on the last line, as soon as I press enter on this line something is going to happ….. ohhhh.. it added a scroll bar.. just what I wanted.. perfect.. submit</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looks like it’s time for a long overdue update. But before I continue, I’m going to go get a glass of water. I lied..kinda.. I get in the kitchen, I take out the Brita.. and notice that it’s only half full, me being a bit of a perfectionist, I fill it up. Duh.. I can’t pour water if there’s water in the filtering reservoir. Damn. Now I have to wait it’s done filtering and that newly added water is at it’s coolest. No water for me, I got Dr. Pepper instead. I need it anyway, I’m feeling a bit sleepy. I got a credit card! Finally. Now I can order stuff online, I’m now part of the digital revolution, didn’t quite feel part of it if I wasn’t able to potentially send a number that, if intercepted, could ruin me for a couple months, yay. I’m not worried actually, just being cynical.</p>

<p>Listening to Lady Like. I’m going to burn a CD now, for John at work, he needs the UT update, but he can’t download it, we can’t figure out why.. he’s on .. Roger’s. Kay, so that’s burning, now what. Oh.. I can plug my iPod to get it charged, it’s dead.. there. Done. Sip of Dr. Pepper.. ahhhh. Woohoo!! Avril!! For those of you who don’t know.. I’m an Avril Lavigne fan.. please, no flaming. I’ve always liked “odd, stupid” music, you shouldn’t be surprised. Disc is done burning. Ouff.. now what. Hey look at that! Ned’s online! I’m now listening to Begin Again, convenient.. I’m finally done The Lord of The RIngs, the books. Took me a year, but I’m done. I was reading it on and off.. it’s not that I’m a slow reader.. just that, I never took the time.. yes.. can’t wait for the Two Towers.</p>

<p>Almost done the glass of Dr. Pepper, and the water should be pretty cold by now. That’s what I’ll be having next, unless the Brita isn’t full.. then I’ll have to refi…… no wait!! I want to buy cased for my PDA and my phone.. and I want to start wearing a belt, so I can hold them.. that’s something I’ve never worn, a belt, no need to, until now. I’m gonna get a cool looking belt that will go with anything, so I’ll only need one. If you’ve never seen Frailty, see it.</p>

<p>I don’t think these paragraphs are separated by topic, like they’re supposed to be, if I remember correctly from Guy Langis’ English class. Oh Well.</p>
