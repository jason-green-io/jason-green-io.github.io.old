  <div class="entry-content"><p>Horray for the holidays. I received a large amount of Future Shop gift certificates. I&rsquo;ll most likely be buying a digital camera, very soon. I&rsquo;m at work, brought my laptop in case it was REALLY dead, but it&rsquo;s not.. so I&rsquo;m not doing much with it. Can&rsquo;t wait for the snow to come, I hope we get alot more than they&rsquo;re forecasting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Damn nag screens are back. I shouldn&rsquo;t complain.. I shouldn&rsquo;t even talk about it. Currently listening to Voulez Vous.. ABBA.. sweeet. Offer still stands for anyone who would like to post on my blog.. enough with the blog.. I&rsquo;m pretty sure anyone reading this is annoyed by all the fuss I&rsquo;ve been making with the redesign.. I know.. it&rsquo;s so insignificant it&rsquo;s not even funny. But it entertained me, and I had fun with the whole technical part of it.</p>

<p>You know what.. I think this calls for a celebration&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to crack open a beer. Tsssst .. clink clink.. damn. Friday night and nothing to do. I&rsquo;m working at 7:30 tomorrow, perhaps it&rsquo;s for the best. I&rsquo;m on the day shift again, ouff, way too early for me. Time flew by between 7:30 and 12:30.. that&rsquo;s one good perk about the shift.</p>

<p>Paragraph break for no reason.. ahh remember those? I&rsquo;m going to have a new years resolution this year.. some &ldquo;fans&rdquo; might be glad to hear it, I&rsquo;m going to try and post everyday in 2003. Quite a challenge.. we&rsquo;ll see how I do. I&rsquo;m also looking forward to making multi spanning entries with numbered parts like everyone else. Ahhhhh&hellip; America.. Simon and Garfunkel.. sigh.. .. sip.</p>

<p>I got a haircut today. I&rsquo;m all ready for &ldquo;les fêtes&rdquo;. I just discoved accents on my keyboard.. for those of you in OS X, and using English as your keyboard layout, open up Keycaps in Applications/Utilities .. now press &ldquo;option&rdquo; and see the white highlited keys.. if you press those with &ldquo;option&rdquo; then a letter, you get the proper accent.. kîck ãss.</p>

<p>Last Saturday I went to Wal-Mart to buy Shampoo, a toothbrush and double-sided tape. When I got to the checkout counters I said &ldquo;fùck dät&rdquo; .. lines were WAY too long. Well.. I got the toothbrush today.. at Wal-Mart.. line wasn&rsquo;t that long. I found a big bottle of shampoo in my cupboard.. so I didn&rsquo;t need to buy any. It&rsquo;s really cheap shampoo.. bulk Costco type.. (yes, costco, I know you&rsquo;re not suprised Lyne) it does the job.</p>

<p>no an den!</p>

<p>no an den!</p>

<p>no an den!</p>

<p>okay.. that was so you know what the an den means.. if you still didn&rsquo;t get it see: Dude Where&rsquo;s My Car. Not quite sure what to do with this section. It&rsquo;s stuff that doesn&rsquo;t appear on the index page right away, you have to click it. Hmmm.. I could put quotes and stuff so that they don&rsquo;t over stretch the index page.. or if the entry is really long, I could cut part of it and put it in here.. oh the possibilities.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also be looking into putting a search bar somewhere so you&rsquo;ll be able to search for all my previous posts. That could be interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m cancelling blogger pro! I&rsquo;m using movable type, and it&rsquo;s the bestest thing ever. This is my first official post with it.. as you can see, I&rsquo;ve had alot of test posts. Just to let you know what&rsquo;s new.. I can now add titles to my entries.. yay, no big deal. Comments, you can tell me how stupid I am.. or mock my spelling and point out my typos. That&rsquo;s about it. New to me is reliability, more flexible templates, kick ass user interface and much much more. One more thing.. if you see &ldquo;do you want to know more?&rdquo; it means the post is extended, meaning there&rsquo;s more if you click the link. If you have any suggestions, find anything broken, leave a comment or drop me an email.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>more entries, damn blogger is broken, it won&rsquo;t let me import all my posts in movable type.. this entry will be in the past by the time I get everything up and running. damn blogger.. okay I&rsquo;m going to typw alot because I want to test the height of the box.. what happens if I reach the end, will it add scroll bars? maybe not.. maybe I&rsquo;ll have the select the text and scroll up by movine the cursor.. that would suck.. I can&rsquo;t see how a polished peice of software like movable type would use something like that.. well.. we&rsquo;ll see I guess.. I&rsquo;m almost there, more that half way.. more than a third now.. I saw Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers on midnight yesterday, it rocked, I&rsquo;m seeing it again tonight with Al, Joe and Leo and Al C. .. and whoever else is going. &ldquo;My precious&rdquo; Gollum rocked.. he was awesome. Ok.. I&rsquo;m on the last line, as soon as I press enter on this line something is going to happ&hellip;.. ohhhh.. it added a scroll bar.. just what I wanted.. perfect.. submit</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looks like it&rsquo;s time for a long overdue update. But before I continue, I&rsquo;m going to go get a glass of water. I lied..kinda.. I get in the kitchen, I take out the Brita.. and notice that it&rsquo;s only half full, me being a bit of a perfectionist, I fill it up. Duh.. I can&rsquo;t pour water if there&rsquo;s water in the filtering reservoir. Damn. Now I have to wait it&rsquo;s done filtering and that newly added water is at it&rsquo;s coolest. No water for me, I got Dr. Pepper instead. I need it anyway, I&rsquo;m feeling a bit sleepy. I got a credit card! Finally. Now I can order stuff online, I&rsquo;m now part of the digital revolution, didn&rsquo;t quite feel part of it if I wasn&rsquo;t able to potentially send a number that, if intercepted, could ruin me for a couple months, yay. I&rsquo;m not worried actually, just being cynical.</p>

<p>Listening to Lady Like. I&rsquo;m going to burn a CD now, for John at work, he needs the UT update, but he can&rsquo;t download it, we can&rsquo;t figure out why.. he&rsquo;s on .. Roger&rsquo;s. Kay, so that&rsquo;s burning, now what. Oh.. I can plug my iPod to get it charged, it&rsquo;s dead.. there. Done. Sip of Dr. Pepper.. ahhhh. Woohoo!! Avril!! For those of you who don&rsquo;t know.. I&rsquo;m an Avril Lavigne fan.. please, no flaming. I&rsquo;ve always liked &ldquo;odd, stupid&rdquo; music, you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. Disc is done burning. Ouff.. now what. Hey look at that! Ned&rsquo;s online! I&rsquo;m now listening to Begin Again, convenient.. I&rsquo;m finally done The Lord of The RIngs, the books. Took me a year, but I&rsquo;m done. I was reading it on and off.. it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m a slow reader.. just that, I never took the time.. yes.. can&rsquo;t wait for the Two Towers.</p>

<p>Almost done the glass of Dr. Pepper, and the water should be pretty cold by now. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be having next, unless the Brita isn&rsquo;t full.. then I&rsquo;ll have to refi&hellip;&hellip; no wait!! I want to buy cased for my PDA and my phone.. and I want to start wearing a belt, so I can hold them.. that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve never worn, a belt, no need to, until now. I&rsquo;m gonna get a cool looking belt that will go with anything, so I&rsquo;ll only need one. If you&rsquo;ve never seen Frailty, see it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think these paragraphs are separated by topic, like they&rsquo;re supposed to be, if I remember correctly from Guy Langis&#8217; English class. Oh Well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>More modifications to the site, I put Arial everywhere.. kinda like it. Nic suggested I put the background static, adds a nice little touch. I added the title, and section.. some people must be reading this and wonder what I&rsquo;m talking about. .. hah.. oh well. Congratulations Nic! He&rsquo;s getting married! woo! FOr the past month I&rsquo;ve been buying cases of V8 juice.. I like V8 juice.. did you know it&rsquo;s 2 servings of vegetables? or so they say. tssssst&hellip; ahhhh&hellip; gulp.. ow. &ldquo;This one time, at band camp&hellip;&rdquo; I love that line near the end of American Pie 2. m.i.l.f. m.i.l.f. m.i.l.f. m.i.l.f.</p>

<p>Mike: So how long do I wait to call?
Trent: A day.
Mike: Tomorrow.
Sue: Tomorrow, then a day.
Trent: Yeah.
Mike: So two days?
Trent: Yeah, I guess you could call it that, two days.
Sue: Definitely, two days is like industry standard.
Trent: You know I used to wait two days to call anybody, but now it&rsquo;s like everyone in town waits two days. So I think three days is kind of money. What do you think?
Sue: Yeah, but two&rsquo;s enough not to look anxious.
Trent: But I think three days is kind of money. You know because you&hellip;
Mike: Yeah, but you know what, mabey I&rsquo;ll wait 3 weeks. How&rsquo;s that? And tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and I just happened to run into her number.
Charles: Then ask her where you met her.
Mike: Yeah, I&rsquo;ll ask her where I met her. I don&rsquo;t remember. What does she look like? And then I&rsquo;ll asked if we fucked. Is that&hellip; would that be&hellip; T, would that be the money?
Trent: You know what. Ha ha ha Mike, laugh all you want but if you call too soon you might scare off a nice baby who&rsquo;s ready to party.
Mike: Well how long are you guys gonna wait to call your babies?
Trent, Sue: Six days.</p>
