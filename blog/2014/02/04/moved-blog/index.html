title: &ldquo;going down the markdown hole&rdquo;</p>

<h2>date: 2014-02-04</h2>

<p>Remember when I said I was going to start using markdown, well that idea ended up changing everything about how I blog. I was looking to simplify, boy did I ever. I can write and publish an article with vim now. Here&rsquo;s how I did it.</p>

<p><em>Platform</em></p>

<p>Blogger is great. .. Blogger is great if you use a web browser on a non-mobile device. Sure they have an iOS app, but it sucks. The web interface to create posts and manage the blog is useless on iOS. I tried writing posts in plain text before copy/pasting into blogger, but then I have to markup the links, and that&rsquo;s annoying. What I&rsquo;m trying to say is blogger sucks.</p>

<p>I want to be able to use vim to write a blog post. I want to be able to start writing somewhere and finish somewhere else. I want to be able to make the posts rich without using stupid wysiwyg toolbars. Enter Dropbox and markdown. Markdown allows me to markup everything easily, in plain text. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what editor you&rsquo;re using, it will always generate the same HTML. I save the posts to a folder in dropbox so they&rsquo;re available everywhere.</p>

<p>Great, I can write posts, how do I publish them and where do they get published? I had 2 choices: <a href="http://scriptogr.am">http://scriptogr.am</a> and <a href="http://calepin.co">http://calepin.co</a>. They both essentially do the same thing, take markdown formatted text files in Dropbox and generate a static blog from them. Scriptogr.am has more features, but Calepin is simple and elegant. Calepin&rsquo;s backend is also open source, in case I have to move. I like that I can&rsquo;t change the theme, one less thing to worry about. Good, now we&rsquo;re in Calepin, how did I move my stuff from blogger?</p>

<p><em>Convert</em></p>

<p>I had to convert the blog (again). I took the Atom feed provided by blogger and threw it in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/larsks/4022537">script</a>. I changed the date format a bit to include the time. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect, I had to modify a couple posts for formatting. This generated about 500 files. Copy to Dropbox .. done.</p>

<p><em>Writing tools</em></p>

<p>Now I can use pretty much anything to write a post. As long as it ends up in Dropbox, it&rsquo;ll get posted. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/byword/id482063361?mt=8">Byword</a> has good markdown support, a bit clunky though. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/daedalus-touch-text-editor/id406964546?mt=8">Daedalus</a> is a great way of dealing with text files. It&rsquo;s not perfect yet, but it&rsquo;s the first app that I&rsquo;m actively submitting bugs for since I really like it. I can use vim to create posts if I feel like it. Dropbox obviously is where all the posts end up. Safe, backed up to the cloud.</p>
