<p>Got these made for 2 reasons. I didn&rsquo;t want to pay much for a couple pieces of plastic, and I picked a geek as a Secret Santa  recipient at work. I had <a href="http://www.3dprint-uk.co.uk/">these</a> guys print the model from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:147819">here</a>. I haven&rsquo;t tested them out much, looks promising.</p>
