<p>I&rsquo;m still alive. The computers here suck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m having a great time. My typical day starts with a 20 minute run at 0500, then breakfast, then an inspection at which point I get yelled at because my sock aren&rsquo;t folded correctly.. then I go to class (drill, first aid, military knowledge .. other boring stuff where people fall asleep). The food is okay .. it&rsquo;s free, I can&rsquo;t complain. Next weekend I might be able to get off the base (our whole platoon is currectly confined to base .. totally normal for the first 4 weeks.) I&rsquo;ll hopfully be getting my parents to send me my laptop so I&rsquo;ll be able to get a high speed connection somewhere in town .. for the time being, I&rsquo;m using loonie pay machines that connect thru dial-up. That&rsquo;s all for now. S&#8217;ouaira.</p>
