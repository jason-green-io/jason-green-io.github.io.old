<p>So I graduated, that was a fun day. Parents came up for that. Now I&rsquo;m in Borden Ontario waiting for my course to start. It&rsquo;s like purgatory.. a big void. I have no idea when my course starts meaning I have no idea how long I&rsquo;ll be here. Borden itself is barren, Barrie is close by, a small metropolis. Barrie isn&rsquo;t walking distance, so I bought a car. 2005 Echo hatchback .. it&rsquo;s blue.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the news.. what&rsquo;s new with you?</p>
