<p>Last week I was in Farnham .. shot my C7, slept in a tent, used Coleman stoves and lanterns, reminded me alot of camping when I was in Scouts. I&rsquo;ve got 4 more days of that .. then I graduate in 1.5 weeks. Excitement is mounting! I&rsquo;m still not sure if I&rsquo;ll be able to go home for Easter.. I have to wait until I present myself to my next unit and ask there. On ouaira. I&rsquo;m pissed that I still haven&rsquo;t seen the ROTS full trailer yet.. dammit.</p>
