<p>So I went to Moncton for a split second.. sorry I didn&rsquo;t get to see everyone.. it was quite an adventure (also quite expensive). Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>

<p>My plan was to take the bus to Toronto at 6:30pm .. not knowing the bus actually leaves for Toronto at 6:30am .. the clerk at the bus station was nice enough to call VIA and see what they had leaving. I took the next train at 6:45pm or something like that.. luckily, the train station isn&rsquo;t too far from the bus station .. cab ride was something like 6 bucks. Get to Toronto around 9:00pm, start looking for a place to stay.. the Royal York is RIGHT THERE .. naa, there&rsquo;s got to be some other place (at this point I&rsquo;m starving). I checked out the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060202233548/http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/YYZBR">Renaissance</a> .. but the game was almost over, so I went back to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060202233548/http://www.fairmont.com/royalyork/">Royal York</a> and stayed there. Ate at the Armadillo Texas Grill .. good burger, good beer. Wake up at 7:00am, take the shuttle to Pearson International. Flight at 10:20am, land in Moncton at 1:20pm. Chill at the parents place for an hour then go out for a beer with Al at Doc&rsquo;s, which turns into supper at Sport&rsquo;s Rock. Then it&rsquo;s off to the bachelor party.. pick up Chris, head to Sussex, find the place no problem.. have a few drinks.. 11:30pm, time to head home. The car breaks down on the Trans-Canada 20 minutes away from the party. Get lift back to the party, end up going home at 3:00am. Wake up at 7:00am .. book a flight to Toronto from Halifax.. leave Halifax at 9:50am or something.. get into Toronto around 11:00am or something. Take the train to Kingston at 3:00pm or something.. then get home around 7:00pm. Whew. Total time travelling > total time in Moncton. It was fun though.. I really like travelling.</p>
