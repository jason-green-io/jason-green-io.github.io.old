<p>I&rsquo;ve been downloading TV shows pretty much 24/7 since I&rsquo;ve been in Kingston; trying to catch up to all the time I missed while in basic. I&rsquo;m happy to report I&rsquo;m finally all caught up. Here&rsquo;s the list of shows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Smallville</li>
<li>Lost</li>
<li>Enterprise</li>
<li>Amazing Race 6</li>
<li>South Park</li>
<li>The O.C.</li>
<li>Scrubs</li>
<li>Grey Matter</li>
</ul>


<p>I think I&rsquo;ll be going downtown tonight, catch a movie, get some grub then drop by the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060206104812/http://www.whatsonkingston.com/entertain/tirnanog/index.cfm">Tir Nan Og</a> in no particular order.</p>
