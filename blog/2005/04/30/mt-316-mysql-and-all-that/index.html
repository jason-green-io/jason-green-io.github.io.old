<p>I switched the site&rsquo;s database to mysql, now the pages load dynamically .. w00t .. you won&rsquo;t notice much.. pages update instantly, so do comments.</p>

<p>Went out last night with buddy Mac, got shit faced. Had the usual Bubba&rsquo;s slice o&#8217; pizza and poutine .. couldn&rsquo;t finish the poutine though, too full .. or drunk. Let me explain Bubba&rsquo;s: it&rsquo;s like King of Donair was before it closed; great pizza and everyone goes there after the bars.</p>
