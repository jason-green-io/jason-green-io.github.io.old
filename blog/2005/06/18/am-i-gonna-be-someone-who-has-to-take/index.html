<p>What a great time. Love it.. I remember back in the day listening to the live Sloan album in Al&rsquo;s basement.. we&rsquo;d listen to it at least once a week .. all the songs have been imprinted in my mind .. now imagine going to a concert and hearing all these songs kinda like for the first time.. but not, since you know them all .. wow. What a great stage presence .. just rocking out.. inciting you, teasing you. Then they switch it up, they can all play each others instruments .. wow. I have an infinite amount more of respect for them now that I&rsquo;ve seen them live.</p>

<p>I get my car today! Parents are visiting from back home, bringing the Trans-Canadamobile to K-town. I&rsquo;m gonna be free! Wow, imagine, being able to go anywhere you want anytime you want .. something I haven&rsquo;t experienced since January.</p>
