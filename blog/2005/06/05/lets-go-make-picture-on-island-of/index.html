<p>The Eagles are so much cooler than I thought. Here&rsquo;s why: This conclusion only works if you&rsquo;ve seen Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy AND you like the twangy instrument called the &ldquo;banjo&rdquo;. Remember when the Earth gets destroyed .. and the camera pans down to reveal the actual Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy? Remember the tune that pretty much starts the movie? It&rsquo;s a song by The Eagles .. yes .. you can call them a country band .. but for some reason they released this crazy ass song called Journey of the Sorcerer on their One Of These Nights album. Get the song now, it&rsquo;s really cool. Buy it off iTunes music store .. yeah. The tune off of the soundtrack is a little bit different .. it&rsquo;s got more of a .. how do you say .. punch to it. The Eagles version seems to just stroll along.. but the movie version seems to have a place to go .. it just moves along faster. .. though it&rsquo;s a short version of the actual song.</p>

<p>SO what have I been up to? mmmm morse code.. lots and lots of morse code. wow.. amazing how much morse code I&rsquo;ve been doing .. I can&rsquo;t really put it into words .. well.. maybe I can .. 7:30-15:30, 5 days a week. I bought head phones today .. so I can &ldquo;copy morse&rdquo; better. You see.. I do what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;copying morse code&rdquo; which means listening to morse code at ridiculously high speeds and typing it out in Notepad. It&rsquo;s a very complicated procedure &ldquo;pfft&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll be doing this for 5 months .. been doing it for about a month now and I&rsquo;m at the brink of insanity. Have you ever been to the brink of insanity? A short description is: &ldquo;hearing patterns of short and long tones in every day life and interpreting them as demons trying to tell you to do bad things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This good ole entry has been brought to you by Jack Daniels, a proud sponsor of greener&rsquo;s sanity since .. Al introduced me to the Jack and Coke ages ago at Doc&rsquo;s .. back in &ldquo;The Coude&rdquo;. Expect more of them .. Jack does so much more than beer; therefore, greener will be drinking more of it (we&rsquo;re allowed storing alcohol in the &ldquo;shacks&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Hey, ya think I can type a little more here .. to compensate for the lack of updates? .. yeah I probably can .. currently listening to That&rsquo;s me Trying on Shatner&rsquo;s album. I like the whole album.. thank you Ryan. Congrats to Lyne and this Phil person on their new apt. Congrats Nic and Teri-Lee for getting married. Congrats Ned and Moe on getting the &ldquo;house&rdquo;. ouuuhh.. New Kids on the Block. That reminds me of last weekend, I went to the Grizz (it&rsquo;s basically a cougar bar), they played Step by Step.. I knew all the words and the young ladies were very impressed. I ended up talking to a french teacher from Mississauga named Brooke. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny if she&rsquo;d try to look herself up on google and stumble on this site? hah. I also bought an iron today .. what else have I bought since I&rsquo;m in Kingston .. high gain antennas for my Linksys router, a summer sleeping bag (which I sleep in every night .. it&rsquo;s what you do in the shacks), a binary watch (yeah.. it tells time in binary), t-shirts .. that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
