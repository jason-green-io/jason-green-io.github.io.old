<p>I bought a blanket for my bed today, it&rsquo;s made out of red fuzziness, it&rsquo;s goes along great with the green fuzziness one I already have. I also bought 2 green fuzziness pillows. Different shade of green. I bought a carpet too, it&rsquo;s a bit fuzzy, I think it&rsquo;s 50% fuzziness, 50% polyester.</p>

<p>Drinking a Timmy&rsquo;s and listening to .. something .. it&rsquo;s Cheating on You by Franz Ferdinand.</p>

<p>Last night I watched Snatch, 28 Days later and Usual Suspects. Tonight I&rsquo;ll be watching a few episodes of The Office (UK) if it ever comes down. (slang for download)</p>

<p>I finally started reading Caravans by James Michener.</p>

<p>Vacation starts in 19 days. .. 2 hours 9 minutes 30 seconds</p>
