<p>Why hello there .. is anyone still out there? I&rsquo;ve got time to kill so I&rsquo;ll let you in on what I&rsquo;ve been doing for the past few weeks. I spent Canada Day in Ottawa with James and Leung-er, to guys on my course, we visited the new War Museum, Leung drove us up and went back, but James and I stayed in Ottawa for an adventure. Sam Roberts was playing on the hill, didn&rsquo;t get to see him much though, we spent most of the night drinking. We did find time to peel away from the bar to get a view of the fireworks, but immediately ran back to Darcy MacGee&rsquo;s so as to have a place to sit down after the festivities were over. When the bar closed, we took a cab to the bus station where a bus would drive us back to K-town at 10:30 in the a.m. The bus station closes at 04:30, so we had to hang out at a 24 hour McDonald&rsquo;s until the station opened. James got hassled by a few individuals thinking he was a skin head or something. The bus overheats in Kanata, delaying our arrival by 45 minutes. Here&rsquo;s some pictures taken by James.</p>

<p>On 9 July, Leung and I went to an air show in Schenectady NY. It was a cool trip there, never been in the Empire State before. We eventually made our way to Albany NY, capital of the Empire State. We toured the Crossgates Mall for a couple hours. We ate at Hooters. I visited the Apple Store. As you can see, I got to experience 2 of my favorite things, Macs and TnA. Here are pictures. (you&rsquo;ll be disappointed, no Hooters OR Apple stuff .. just an A-10 and an LC-130)</p>

<p>Last weekend I spent the weekend at Mac&rsquo;s cottage with Mac and Woodsy, on a lake. I &ldquo;learned&rdquo; to water-ski .. and I drank beer .. and got a wicked sun burn. Here are some pictures.</p>
