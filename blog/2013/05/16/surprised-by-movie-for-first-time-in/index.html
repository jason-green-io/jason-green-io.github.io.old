<p>Saw Star Trek: Into Darkness tonight. I sure am glad I didn&rsquo;t read anything about the plot. I was pleasantly surprised. I liked the switcheroos and regiggering of plot elements from the old films. Fantastic special effects. And the lens flares, oh man, let me tell you, those lens flares were VERY flary.</p>
