<p>I don&rsquo;t often do product reviews (ever? I this the first?). This product is so good and I&rsquo;m so happy with it that I have the need to share.</p>

<p>I needed a case for my phone that could also replace my wallet. I didn&rsquo;t want the front to get scratched like my last iPhone. I ended up getting a <a href="http://www.dodocase.com/products/durables-wallet-for-iphone-4-5">DODOcase durables sleeve</a>. That case is now on sale on eBay. The pockets on it weren&rsquo;t adequate as a wallet replacement. Cards kept falling out. Then I found the <a href="http://www.padandquill.com/cases-for-iphone-ipod-touch/little-pocket-book-for-iphone-5.html">Pad &amp; Quill Little Pocket Book</a>. I love it. If you&rsquo;re looking to consolidate your wallet and iPhone, go buy one now. They&rsquo;re very well made and smell nice. (Yes, I said smell)</p>
