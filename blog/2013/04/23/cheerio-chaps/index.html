<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they actually say that or not, but we&rsquo;re going to find out. We&rsquo;re moving to England for 3 years.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be in NB 3 &ndash; 6 May, moving sometime in late July. We&rsquo;ll be having a number of going away parties to get some use of our deck. For those who haven&rsquo;t visited us in Ottawa yet .. now would be a good time :)</p>
