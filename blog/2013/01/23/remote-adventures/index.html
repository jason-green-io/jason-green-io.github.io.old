<p><em>bash</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using my iPad to ssh into my home server a lot lately. I have it tethered to an Apple Bluetooth wireless keyboard. I also picked up an incase origami workspace, which I love. Here&rsquo;s something I learned. In bash when you type a long command (which takes time if you DON&rsquo;T have a keyboard) and notice you made a typo in the first character, you can type C-a to go to the beginning of the line and C-e to go to the end. Now, if you run screen, you&rsquo;d have to do a C-a C-a. Take a look at the readline section of the bash man page.</p>

<p><em>tmux</em></p>

<p>I discovered tmux. I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about it yet. Seems alot of the common command are the same as screen, so that&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p><em>RealVNC</em></p>

<p>OS X screen sharing is good if you have a fast connection. But if you&rsquo;re tethered to a 3G connection and your home broadband only has 400kb/s upstream, it is VERY slow. RealVNc has a server for OS X, I&rsquo;m surprised it took me this long to notice. The free license allows 5 machines. I love the RealVNC app on iOS, now I just VPN to home and use the iOS app. The connection auto-figures-out the speed and adjusts the quality accordingly.</p>
