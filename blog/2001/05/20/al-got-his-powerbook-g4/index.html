<p>Al got his PowerBook G4, and I&rsquo;m not as wireless as before, but that will change soon enough. &ldquo;That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball.&rdquo; What could I eat.. oh! everyone, thank you everyone for your picture submissions to the main page (that means you Monique, stand up and bow). I&rsquo;m hungry.. that reminds me of the SubWay commercial. Who knows what I&rsquo;m talking about?</p>
