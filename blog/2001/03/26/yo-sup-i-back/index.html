<p>Yo, sup? I&rsquo;m back. A few changes though. No more primary visual cortex stimulation of the day, check my main page for that. Since Lynie put a link up, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to bore her visitors, so I&rsquo;m starting again. I find I have time.. kinda.. and a new computer :) (the iBook if you&rsquo;ve been reading). I&rsquo;m still here, sitting in college, typing away in geocities instead of doing HTML (the course). Actually.. theoretically (I love that word) I <em>AM</em> doing HTML, just not the assigned assignments.. . ha! I just got when the word assignments comes from.. they assign.. .. oh you knew that? well.. pffft fine! Remi is down and we&rsquo;re filming a movie, the details are top secret so I can&rsquo;t tell you anything.</p>
