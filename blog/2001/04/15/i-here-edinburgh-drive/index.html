<p>I&rsquo;m here a Edinburgh drive. Updating ma brain. I got a glimps of the new Aliant building (I keep writing the word without an &ldquo;i&rdquo;).
It&rsquo;s, amazing! Colorful, big, modern. It&rsquo;s as if Ikea designed the whole thing. Today is not busy at all.
It&rsquo;s really dead. 46 available on a Sunday. It&rsquo;s been snowing for the past 3 days, I checked the ofrecast, looks like it&rsquo;ll be snowing for another 3. Sucky.
Again I&rsquo;m writing in detached phrases. For the first time I&rsquo;m using Notpad and the built in FTP client in WIndows. Pretty cool, alot of typing but it gets the job done pretty well if you know what you&rsquo;re doing.
I&rsquo;m going to do something totally out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>carbonated water, sugar/glucose-fructose, caramel colour, phosphoric acid, natural flavors, caffeine.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s Coke. The ingredients. Joker is supposed to be working but he&rsquo;s nowhere to be found. Must have been eaten by a lion in a convenience store or something.
What the heck, I&rsquo;m going to make this entry REALLY long. I have so much time on my hads right now, I have no reason not to (double negative, I know, don&rsquo;t stop not criticizing me).
If I want to make it long, I have to think of content, content is always key.. hmmm&hellip; uhhhh&hellip; well&hellip;.. hmm&hellip;. damn.. I can&rsquo;t keep typing that the whole way thru, that&rsquo;s boring.
Hmmm&hellip; uhh&hellip; I have to talk about something. Or, I could copy/paste something that&rsquo;s intresting and save me the effort of thinking something up. What could I copy/paste&hellip;
hmm.. uhhh.. welll&hellip; hmm&hellip;</p>

<p>carbonated water, sugar/glucose-fructose, caramel colour, phosphoric acid, natural flavors, caffeine.</p>

<p>No you idiot something else other than that. Damn periodical morons, they always think they can be so funny.
Oh, someone just got a call, it beeped.</p>
