<p>If you look back at earlier updates, you&rsquo;ll notice it says &ldquo;[an error occurred while processing this directive]&rdquo; That&rsquo;s stuff left over from Geocities. NBNet tries to process the comments and the server returns an error in the form of text embedded in my page. No worries, I may get around removing those. Or maybe I should just leave them there as tributes to this page&rsquo;s past. Oh hey! I love commentary. Specifically on DVDs (you usually don&rsquo;t get commentary on VHS). It gives you a whole new perspective on watching a movie. THings that aren&rsquo;t obvious, or aren&rsquo;t made clear in a release can easily be explained during commentary. I may be buying Contact on DVD even though I said I wouldn&rsquo;t buy DVDs of movies I already have on VHS. BUt the DVD has 3 tracks of commentary. Woohoo! And one of those is of Jodie Foster. Hallo! Jodie Foster doing commentary on my second favorite movie! It may be the next movie I buy. I was dissapointed to read (Amazon.com) that there&rsquo;s no commentary on The Sixth Sense, I didn&rsquo;t get that.</p>
