<p>I&rsquo;ve found a new home for ma barin.. it has a bit more ads, but at lease it doesn&rsquo;t have a pop up thing.. That&rsquo;s something I didn&rsquo;t like about yahoo.. pop ups. I worked today, fun fun. I&rsquo;m getting a cold, my nose is sniffling. I&rsquo;m enjoying my laptop very much right now, I&rsquo;m sitting in my favorite chair and I&rsquo;m just typing away comfortably. Love it.</p>
