<p>In college, not doing anything in Java class. Leo and Remi are playing Starcraft. I was surfing Hot or Not a couple minutes ago with Wayne and Dave. Fun stuff. It&rsquo;s snowing like a m<strong><em>**f</em></strong> (I hate swearing). Big ass snow flakes. Really big snowflakes.. nono, you don&rsquo;t understand, they were HUGE! Again I&rsquo;m using FTP and notepad, cool stuff. I&rsquo;m really used to it now. Damn cache server, it doesn&rsquo;t update when I press reload on the browser because it keeps a copy of my site in Fredericton. It sucks. AH HA! I&rsquo;ve found a way to bypass it. I&rsquo;m useing safeweb, it&rsquo;s a secure &ldquo;browser tool&rdquo; that acts as a portal to the actual internet. Anyway, it works, and it rules.</p>
