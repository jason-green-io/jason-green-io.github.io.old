<p>December already. Time flies. I helped Joe install Mac OS X today, I am the master of Mac OS X.. ok well, maybe not THE master.. maybe a Jedi, I&rsquo;m very knowledgable in the ways of Mac OS X (pronounced &ldquo;Mac oh ess ten&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t get me started on that). I&rsquo;m working in 5 hours.. I slept 16 hours yesterday, we&rsquo;ll see how today goes. I&rsquo;ll try making a &ldquo;same day&rdquo; update, something I haven&rsquo;t done in a while; it&rsquo;ll be to inform you of how the day went having the freaky sleeping habbit and all.</p>
