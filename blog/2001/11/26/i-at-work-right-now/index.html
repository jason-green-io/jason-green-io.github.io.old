<p>I&rsquo;m at work right now, fun stuff.. it&rsquo;s busy off and on, right now it&rsquo;s not. I&rsquo;m reading The Fellowship of the Ring right now, very cool stuff. Fantasy stories usually don&rsquo;t intrest me, but in this case.. I&rsquo;m intrested in a classic.. and I know why it&rsquo;s so popular, it&rsquo;s good. Almost halfway, trying to get it done before the movie comes out. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll succeed. I bought an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>, it&rsquo;s real nice. Expensive, but worth every penny.</p>
