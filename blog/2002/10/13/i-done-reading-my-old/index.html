<p>I&rsquo;m done reading my old posts, I&rsquo;ve learned a few things, noticed a few things.. very enlightning. I went thru and actually corrected a few code errors. I was listening to Bootylicious on the way to work. I am so bored. Gary is cleaning the print area, he&rsquo;s desperatly looking for stuff to put in the &ldquo;Shred-it&rdquo; recycling bin. I happen to be sitting right next to the print area. When the printer turns on, it&rsquo;s vents blow the refreshing smell of toner right in my face. It&rsquo;s wonderful. It&rsquo;s only been 2 hours!! 8 to go. I&rsquo;m looking forward to supper, I&rsquo;m very hungry.. I think I&rsquo;m going to go get something to eat.. like junk, and caffeine.There&hellip; Dr. Pepper, Cruncheez and a Coffee Crisp, everything a bored computer geek needs to satisfy his hunger.</p>
