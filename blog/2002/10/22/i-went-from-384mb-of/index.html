<p>I went from 384MB of RAM to 128MB this morning. Now my computer is dead slow. But that&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ll last until the 512 chip comes in. My RAM went into Lynie&rsquo;s new computer, my old iBook, there are pictures of it in my <a href="../dypicgen/dypicgen.cgi">pictures</a> section. It used to be called AgentSmith.</p>
