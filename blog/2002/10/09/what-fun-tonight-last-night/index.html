<p>What fun! Tonight, (last night), Lyne, Al and I played Trivial Pursuit. Lyne won, but by a very narrow margin. I sucked most of the game but caught up very quickly near the end. I&rsquo;m in bed listening to Take Five by Dave Brubeck.. well not anymore, the song just ended, now it&rsquo;s Bran Van 3000. &ldquo;All I want to do is love you&rdquo;</p>
