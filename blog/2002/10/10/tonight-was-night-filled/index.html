<p>Tonight was a night filled of a whole lotta nothing, watched TSS, a bit of Frantic starring Harrison Ford, then bed (my current location). I&rsquo;m typing in the dark.. and I&rsquo;m actually hitting the keys I&rsquo;m supposed to be hitting. Pretty cool, next thing you know, I won&rsquo;t need to look at the keyboard. I love cheese. Currently listening to Good Day Sunshine, good Beatles tune. But it&rsquo;s not playing anymore. &ldquo;Baby when I heard you, for the first time I knew, we were meant to be as one&rdquo;</p>
