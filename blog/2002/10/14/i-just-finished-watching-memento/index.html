<p>I just finished Watching Memento, was on TMN, excellent film. I&rsquo;ve got it on DVD, but I was one of those people who bought it as soon as it came out, and didn&rsquo;t wait for the special edition. Now that the special edition is out, I&rsquo;m kicking myself in the ass. I might just buy the special edition anyway and try to sell the original to a poor unsuspecting shmoe. Is that how you spell shmoe? I dunno. Ohhh.. commercial for the Soprano&rsquo;s.. it&rsquo;s funny reading what I just typed.. I actually saw the &ldquo;r&rdquo; as a gun. I think I might buy that too.</p>
