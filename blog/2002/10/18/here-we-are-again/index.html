<p>Here we are again
and we&rsquo;re looking at each other as if each other were to blame.
You think you&rsquo;re so smart, but I&rsquo;ve seen you naked
and I&rsquo;ll probably see you naked again.
MillI Vanilli told you to Blame it On The Rain
but if you blame it on the rain tell me
what can be gained so, if all else fails you can blame it on me.</p>

<p>[Chorus]
If all else fails you can blame it on me.
If all else fails you can blame it on me.
If all else fails blame it on me.
If all else fails you can blame it on me.</p>

<p>Then you smile again
but you&rsquo;re looking at me as if there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m supposed to say.
Forgive me Father,
but I&rsquo;m falling in love and that&rsquo;s all I have for confession today.
Maybe if you&rsquo;d ask me on any other given day
I wouldn&rsquo;t have time for you or anything that you say
but it&rsquo;s alright now, you can blame it on me.</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>Yes dear I love you,
but sometimes I think that love&rsquo;s not enough for you.
So you want to play mind games,
well that&rsquo;s fine, go ahead, la la la I can&rsquo;t hear you.
Here you are
and you&rsquo;re a hundred thousand miles away;
They say that absence makes the heart grow fungus.
I wax poetic as you&rsquo;re waxing your legs,
you say you think there&rsquo;s a traitor among us.</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>
