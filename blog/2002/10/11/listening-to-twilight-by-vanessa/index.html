<p>Listening to Twilight by Vanessa Carlton, a very talented lady. You can feel the emotion in her music, it&rsquo;s not just a replica of what pop tries to do, this sounds like the real deal. Think Sarah Maclachlan and Jewel. So I&rsquo;m alone at home with no chat buddy. Buddy is gone. I&rsquo;m sad that buddy is gone, for more reasons than one. The music isn&rsquo;t helping.</p>
