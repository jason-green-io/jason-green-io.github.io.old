<p>Wow, I was looking thru message boards at work and someone posted this link <a href="http://archive.org/">Archive.org</a>. Bascally, you type in an address, and you can see what that page looked like in the past. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981206161737/personal.nbnet.nb.ca/greener/">this</a> is what my page looked like 6 years ago. I think I&rsquo;m going to modify my exsisting page so some of those elements come back, I find it was very nice.</p>
