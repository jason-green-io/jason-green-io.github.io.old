<p>Well, a new month and I don&rsquo;t need to code 3 pages, woohoo, I love this blog thing.. and I heard someone else is taking advantage of it also.. <a href="http://vectra.diaryland.com/">vectra</a> woohoo. I&rsquo;m listening to Chris Colepaugh, it&rsquo;s 5:03, it rocks. Went to Doc&rsquo;s with Ned and Al, actually they were already there, I met them there. Drank a few.. more than a few, maybe 5. T&#8217;was fun. Talked to Lynie afterwards, thats always fun. I noticed there&rsquo;s alot of posts on the guestbook, keept them comming!! Time to try to fall asleep, later.</p>
