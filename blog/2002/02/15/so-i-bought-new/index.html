<p>So I bought a new clip for my phone today, and I&rsquo;m watching my favorite TV show, The Screen Savers. They rock! I&rsquo;m done switching over to the year 2002, Ma Brain I mean .. (the site). I have no idea what to write, like you haven&rsquo;t read that before.. I just though of a funny line in an IBM commercial .. know which one I&rsquo;m talking about? &ldquo;They stole all our servers!&rdquo; .. and then .. &ldquo;Uh no, didn&rsquo;t you get my email, we moved everything onto that one.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m such a little computer nerd. I got a promotion, my title is now Workload Manager.. though I&rsquo;m not really management. Yay.</p>
