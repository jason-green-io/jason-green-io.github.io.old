<p>I&rsquo;m in bed trying to fall asleep. I was very tired today because of lack of sleep in the past 4 days. I&rsquo;ve finally recovered, but now I can&rsquo;t fall asleep. Not a big problem.. at least I&rsquo;ll get sleep. Ned and Monique were down for the holidays, them, Al and I went to Right Spot to see CCCC, they rocked the house down, very awesome. I danced for the most part of the night. then yesterday Ned and I saw Two Towers, my third time, what can I say, I ove the movie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I go out, well I know I&rsquo;m gonna be, I&rsquo;m gonna be the man who&rsquo;s goes along with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today is the ex-CPC staff party. Woohoo, I&rsquo;m actually kinda excited! Been looking forward to it.</p>
