<p>Horray for the holidays. I received a large amount of Future Shop gift certificates. I&rsquo;ll most likely be buying a digital camera, very soon. I&rsquo;m at work, brought my laptop in case it was REALLY dead, but it&rsquo;s not.. so I&rsquo;m not doing much with it. Can&rsquo;t wait for the snow to come, I hope we get alot more than they&rsquo;re forecasting.</p>
