<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s time for a long overdue update. But before I continue, I&rsquo;m going to go get a glass of water. I lied..kinda.. I get in the kitchen, I take out the Brita.. and notice that it&rsquo;s only half full, me being a bit of a perfectionist, I fill it up. Duh.. I can&rsquo;t pour water if there&rsquo;s water in the filtering reservoir. Damn. Now I have to wait it&rsquo;s done filtering and that newly added water is at it&rsquo;s coolest. No water for me, I got Dr. Pepper instead. I need it anyway, I&rsquo;m feeling a bit sleepy. I got a credit card! Finally. Now I can order stuff online, I&rsquo;m now part of the digital revolution, didn&rsquo;t quite feel part of it if I wasn&rsquo;t able to potentially send a number that, if intercepted, could ruin me for a couple months, yay. I&rsquo;m not worried actually, just being cynical.</p>

<p>Listening to Lady Like. I&rsquo;m going to burn a CD now, for John at work, he needs the UT update, but he can&rsquo;t download it, we can&rsquo;t figure out why.. he&rsquo;s on .. Roger&rsquo;s. Kay, so that&rsquo;s burning, now what. Oh.. I can plug my iPod to get it charged, it&rsquo;s dead.. there. Done. Sip of Dr. Pepper.. ahhhh. Woohoo!! Avril!! For those of you who don&rsquo;t know.. I&rsquo;m an Avril Lavigne fan.. please, no flaming. I&rsquo;ve always liked &ldquo;odd, stupid&rdquo; music, you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. Disc is done burning. Ouff.. now what. Hey look at that! Ned&rsquo;s online! I&rsquo;m now listening to Begin Again, convenient.. I&rsquo;m finally done The Lord of The RIngs, the books. Took me a year, but I&rsquo;m done. I was reading it on and off.. it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m a slow reader.. just that, I never took the time.. yes.. can&rsquo;t wait for the Two Towers.</p>

<p>Almost done the glass of Dr. Pepper, and the water should be pretty cold by now. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be having next, unless the Brita isn&rsquo;t full.. then I&rsquo;ll have to refi&hellip;&hellip; no wait!! I want to buy cased for my PDA and my phone.. and I want to start wearing a belt, so I can hold them.. that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve never worn, a belt, no need to, until now. I&rsquo;m gonna get a cool looking belt that will go with anything, so I&rsquo;ll only need one. If you&rsquo;ve never seen Frailty, see it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think these paragraphs are separated by topic, like they&rsquo;re supposed to be, if I remember correctly from Guy Langis&#8217; English class. Oh Well.</p>
