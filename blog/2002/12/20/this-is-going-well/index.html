<p>Damn nag screens are back. I shouldn&rsquo;t complain.. I shouldn&rsquo;t even talk about it. Currently listening to Voulez Vous.. ABBA.. sweeet. Offer still stands for anyone who would like to post on my blog.. enough with the blog.. I&rsquo;m pretty sure anyone reading this is annoyed by all the fuss I&rsquo;ve been making with the redesign.. I know.. it&rsquo;s so insignificant it&rsquo;s not even funny. But it entertained me, and I had fun with the whole technical part of it.</p>

<p>You know what.. I think this calls for a celebration&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to crack open a beer. Tsssst .. clink clink.. damn. Friday night and nothing to do. I&rsquo;m working at 7:30 tomorrow, perhaps it&rsquo;s for the best. I&rsquo;m on the day shift again, ouff, way too early for me. Time flew by between 7:30 and 12:30.. that&rsquo;s one good perk about the shift.</p>

<p>Paragraph break for no reason.. ahh remember those? I&rsquo;m going to have a new years resolution this year.. some &ldquo;fans&rdquo; might be glad to hear it, I&rsquo;m going to try and post everyday in 2003. Quite a challenge.. we&rsquo;ll see how I do. I&rsquo;m also looking forward to making multi spanning entries with numbered parts like everyone else. Ahhhhh&hellip; America.. Simon and Garfunkel.. sigh.. .. sip.</p>

<p>I got a haircut today. I&rsquo;m all ready for &ldquo;les fêtes&rdquo;. I just discoved accents on my keyboard.. for those of you in OS X, and using English as your keyboard layout, open up Keycaps in Applications/Utilities .. now press &ldquo;option&rdquo; and see the white highlited keys.. if you press those with &ldquo;option&rdquo; then a letter, you get the proper accent.. kîck ãss.</p>

<p>Last Saturday I went to Wal-Mart to buy Shampoo, a toothbrush and double-sided tape. When I got to the checkout counters I said &ldquo;fùck dät&rdquo; .. lines were WAY too long. Well.. I got the toothbrush today.. at Wal-Mart.. line wasn&rsquo;t that long. I found a big bottle of shampoo in my cupboard.. so I didn&rsquo;t need to buy any. It&rsquo;s really cheap shampoo.. bulk Costco type.. (yes, costco, I know you&rsquo;re not suprised Lyne) it does the job.</p>

<p>no an den!</p>

<p>no an den!</p>

<p>no an den!</p>

<p>okay.. that was so you know what the an den means.. if you still didn&rsquo;t get it see: Dude Where&rsquo;s My Car. Not quite sure what to do with this section. It&rsquo;s stuff that doesn&rsquo;t appear on the index page right away, you have to click it. Hmmm.. I could put quotes and stuff so that they don&rsquo;t over stretch the index page.. or if the entry is really long, I could cut part of it and put it in here.. oh the possibilities.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also be looking into putting a search bar somewhere so you&rsquo;ll be able to search for all my previous posts. That could be interesting.</p>
