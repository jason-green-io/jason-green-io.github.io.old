<p>I&rsquo;m cancelling blogger pro! I&rsquo;m using movable type, and it&rsquo;s the bestest thing ever. This is my first official post with it.. as you can see, I&rsquo;ve had alot of test posts. Just to let you know what&rsquo;s new.. I can now add titles to my entries.. yay, no big deal. Comments, you can tell me how stupid I am.. or mock my spelling and point out my typos. That&rsquo;s about it. New to me is reliability, more flexible templates, kick ass user interface and much much more. One more thing.. if you see &ldquo;do you want to know more?&rdquo; it means the post is extended, meaning there&rsquo;s more if you click the link. If you have any suggestions, find anything broken, leave a comment or drop me an email.</p>
