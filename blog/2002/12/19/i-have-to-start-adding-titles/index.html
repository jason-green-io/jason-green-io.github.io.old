<p>more entries, damn blogger is broken, it won&rsquo;t let me import all my posts in movable type.. this entry will be in the past by the time I get everything up and running. damn blogger.. okay I&rsquo;m going to typw alot because I want to test the height of the box.. what happens if I reach the end, will it add scroll bars? maybe not.. maybe I&rsquo;ll have the select the text and scroll up by movine the cursor.. that would suck.. I can&rsquo;t see how a polished peice of software like movable type would use something like that.. well.. we&rsquo;ll see I guess.. I&rsquo;m almost there, more that half way.. more than a third now.. I saw Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers on midnight yesterday, it rocked, I&rsquo;m seeing it again tonight with Al, Joe and Leo and Al C. .. and whoever else is going. &ldquo;My precious&rdquo; Gollum rocked.. he was awesome. Ok.. I&rsquo;m on the last line, as soon as I press enter on this line something is going to happ&hellip;.. ohhhh.. it added a scroll bar.. just what I wanted.. perfect.. submit</p>
