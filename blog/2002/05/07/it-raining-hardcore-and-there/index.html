<p>It&rsquo;s raining, hardcore. And there is alot of wind too. Lynie, do you still read this, is yes, I have a question for you, WHY HAVEN&rsquo;T YOU POSTED ON MY GUESTBOOK!! hint hint. A guestbook, by definition, is a place where you log a visit to a web page. If you visit a web page and not log it, I think it&rsquo;s a type of an insult; kinda like &ldquo;your page wasn&rsquo;t good enough to take the time to comment on&rdquo;.. maybe my page isn&rsquo;t that good. That&rsquo;s fine though, you don&rsquo;t HAVE to log your visit, I just prefer you do. Oh, if anyone would like to post to Ma Brain (like anyone would want to post to a blog that gets maybe.. 0.3 hits a day) I can give you access and you can add posts like this one. Could be kinda interesting. I&rsquo;m primed for Episode II, can&rsquo;t wait.. it&rsquo;s gonna be good. I have tickets for the Midnight showing, bought them today and they still have about 250 tickets left.. so if you want in, buy them now, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they won&rsquo;t last long. I&rsquo;m going hiking on Monday, finally doing the Dobson Trail, something I&rsquo;ve wanted to do in a long time, a long time. I&rsquo;m ready to go, all packed, all I need is food.</p>
