<p>Here is something better than what I posted yesterday. I got a satellite dish! It was cool setting it up, did it all by myself.. with the help of the manual and my neighbor&rsquo;s tools. I&rsquo;m off for the next 2 days, woohoo! If you&rsquo;re reading this, go in the feedback section now and post something, please.. I hate seeing it empty. If you don&rsquo;t want to do it, then done, that&rsquo;s fine.. I still don&rsquo;t have any suggestions for a new name, and I&rsquo;m not going to decide. Give me a name, please. I sound like that Oxy Clean guy, trying to sell tubs of white paste. APPROX. VOLUME, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m seeing now, it&rsquo;s on my Nalgene bottle.</p>
