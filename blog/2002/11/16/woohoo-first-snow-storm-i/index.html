<p>Woohoo! First snow storm.. I hope. Forecast calls for 20-30 cms, and I&rsquo;m off, so I&rsquo;ll probally go out and have a stroll in the snow. I haven&rsquo;t been up to much these days, nothing different. Went to see Jimmy Swift Band and Grand Theft Bus with Al on Saturday, I think I went out Wednesday and Thursday too. Not sure. I bought Sopranos season 3, Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring Special Edition and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, only thing left to watch is Sopranos.</p>

<p>Lady I just feel like
I won&rsquo;t catch you
out of my mind
I feel love for the first time
and I know that is true
I can turn by the look in your eyes</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to start work on a back ground for my site, be back when I&rsquo;m done.</p>
