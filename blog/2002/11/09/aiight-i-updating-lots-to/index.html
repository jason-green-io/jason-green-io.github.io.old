<p>Aiight.. I&rsquo;m updating. Lots to talk about.. but nothing personal..Went to Navigators with Pat and Jack from work, good times..yesterday I went to Cosmo to &ldquo;celebrate Cindy&rsquo;s promotion&rdquo;.. but really it was was just a reason to go out.. saw Adele, but she kinda ignored me. ohh.. that was personal.. anywho I drank ALOT.. 5 double Jack and Coke&rsquo;s and a beer. Tonight was a slow night.. 4 large Clancy&rsquo;s&hellip; mmmm Clancy&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m listening to The Way by Fastball. I&rsquo;m getting a bit tired. I need a ti dodo. Bu I&rsquo;ll keep writing here instead. I got rid of my landline.. I only have a cell now.. I think cell phones will take over wired phones pretty soon.. just like on Seaquest DSV. The whole tablet PC buzz that&rsquo;s going on now doesn&rsquo;t suprise me.. I think that&rsquo;s the wave of the future.. but I agree with the critics.. the first generation sucks.. it&rsquo;ll only get better. Think PADDs from Star Trek TNG. &ldquo;Right about now, the funk soul brother&rdquo; love that song.. I also like She&rsquo;s All That.. with Rachel Leigh Cook.. and Josey And the Pussycats.. she reminds me of a friend I have.. dunno why.. fuzz. &ldquo;Feel&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m starting all over again&rdquo; What else is new.. I&rsquo;m single, don&rsquo;t think I ever mentioned that here, in case people read this to know what&rsquo;s going on.. ahhhh&hellip; whatever.. gnight.</p>
