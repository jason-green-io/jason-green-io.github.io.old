<p>Kay, I wasn&rsquo;t planning on changing the entire look of the site.. but I got really bored.. and I only have 21 days left in my trial copy of Photoshop so I had to do something. I think it looks pretty cool. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be refinements.. there&rsquo;s stuff I don&rsquo;t like, but since it&rsquo;s real early, I&rsquo;ll call it quits for now.</p>
