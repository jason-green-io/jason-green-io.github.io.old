<p>So I&rsquo;m done updating 00 and 02, that would leave 01, which I can do today at work. 2 posts in one day, that&rsquo;s pretty good. I&rsquo;m listening to Kokomo, good tune. I&rsquo;m also thinking of bringing back PVCOTD.. if you don&rsquo;t know what that is, you may find out, if you want to know, read 00 April. I may have figured out a way to easily update in here by using Unix scripts, that would be cool. &ldquo;Ven conmigo&rdquo; good tune. Sip, sip.. Coke from MacDo, mmmmmm sticky flat fountain pop.</p>
