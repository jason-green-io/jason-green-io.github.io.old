<p>Ma Brain is changing, in hopes of posting more often, I&rsquo;m changing the format so that the whole month is on one page, that way I won&rsquo;t have to create extra files and alot of menus and links. It&rsquo;ll suck if you want to read everything previous, but I&rsquo;ll keep the file naming convention easy enough, I may even include some kind of index. I think I&rsquo;ll reformat the whole thing, that would mean incorperating all the old day by day posts into monthly pages, it&rsquo;s alot of work, but my patience with coding versus my will to actually getting stuff out there is coliding in a mediocre clash of non-important things.</p>
