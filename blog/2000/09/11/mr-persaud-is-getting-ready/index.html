<p>Mr. Persaud is getting ready for our Unix course. Lettle do people in here know, but I already have Unix experience. Actually, Unix was my first introduction to the Internet. Back in the old days when everything was text based, I&rsquo;d dial up with my 2400bps modem in to Universite de Moncton&rsquo;s Bosoleil service. It would give me the chance to FTP, IRC, and later on use Lynx to &ldquo;surf&rdquo; the web. I also had email access, but the only other person I knew who had email in Moncton at that time was Nick. My old email was <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x63;&#x6d;&#97;&#x40;&#98;&#111;&#x73;&#x6f;&#108;&#x65;&#x69;&#108;&#x2e;&#x75;&#x6d;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#99;&#116;&#x6f;&#110;&#46;&#x63;&#97;&#46;">&#99;&#109;&#97;&#x40;&#x62;&#111;&#115;&#x6f;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#117;&#x6d;&#111;&#x6e;&#x63;&#x74;&#111;&#x6e;&#46;&#x63;&#x61;&#46;</a> Wow, brings back memories. I haven&rsquo;t put a picture in here in a long time. Here goes one.</p>

<p>There we go, that&rsquo;s much better. Oh.. here we go with the course, yay. There&rsquo;s a Power Point presentation going on here with a list of operating systems.. guess what&hellip; Mac OS isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
