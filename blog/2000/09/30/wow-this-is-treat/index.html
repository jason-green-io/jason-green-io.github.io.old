<p>Wow, this is a treat, two updates in the same day.. haven&rsquo;t done that in awhile. I&rsquo;m waiting for calls now.. it&rsquo;s nice.. I haven&rsquo;t seen it this dead since&hellip; 3 weeks ago. Of course.. it is 1:17 in the morning in Ont./Que. I think I&rsquo;m going to move Ma Brain to NBNet.. I don&rsquo;t know why.. just because. I&rsquo;ll probally put a automatic redirecting link thingy, or something. I&rsquo;m so thirsty, I have a nice half full cup of warm Coke waiting at the appartment. mmmm warm Coke. My shift ends in 40 minutes. My Dad is supposed to by me an iBook if I pass all my courses at Christmas. Would be nice. When I get back, I&rsquo;m going to take a picture of something, and put it up here. I&rsquo;m also going to resize the picture on September 18th, it doesn&rsquo;t fit. It&rsquo;s set at 640 by 480.. but the frame size is only 622.. so it stretches it. Is that how you spell streach.. I don&rsquo;t know how to spell sthreth. I need a dikttionarie.</p>
