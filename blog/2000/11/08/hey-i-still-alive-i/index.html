<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m still alive. I haven&rsquo;t updated lately.. duh.. wow parkay has new designer bowls out.. gotta get me one of those. I&rsquo;m writing this page using BBEdit 6.0.. wow what a cool editor, I love Macs.. Al got an iMac ifyou don&rsquo;t already know. I kicks ass, Im on it now, in fact, it has become my primary computer. The one I use the most. I cleaned the kitchen today, it was way overdue. I learned how to play Money by Pink Floyd.. hmm, what else is new.. I bought The Matrix on DVD. Wow.. intresting guest star on Seinfeld.. my hands are cold. I&rsquo;ll stop now.</p>
