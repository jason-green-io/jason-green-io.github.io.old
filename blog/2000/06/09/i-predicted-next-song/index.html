<p>I predicted the next song that was goin to play on Winamp, I was right Shalalalala :) It&rsquo;s Friday, the last day of college. I have one exam this afternoon and 6 more next week. Wednesday is D-day. (Done day) After that I will no longer be &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; by needing to go to this building on Mountain Rd. Crystal Palace Cinemas is also openning all day for summer sometime next week, so I&rsquo;ll get more hours, and more money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boom boom boom&rdquo;</p>
