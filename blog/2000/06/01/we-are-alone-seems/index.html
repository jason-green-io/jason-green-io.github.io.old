<p>&ldquo;If we are alone, seems like an awful wast of space&rdquo;</p>

<p>I just finished watching Contact, one of my top 3 favorite movies. Jodie Foster&rsquo;s character, Ellie Arroway, is the closest you can come to describing me, in my opinion. I cry everytime Ellie&rsquo;s dad dies. I need to read the book again.</p>
