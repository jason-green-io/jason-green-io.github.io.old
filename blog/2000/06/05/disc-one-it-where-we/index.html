<p>Disc One
It&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve begun, it&rsquo;s all my greatest hits,
And if you are a fan then you know that you&rsquo;ve
already got &lsquo;em</p>

<p>Disc Two
It was all brand new, and album&rsquo;s worth of songs,
but we had to leave the whole disc blank because
Some other label bought &lsquo;em</p>

<p>Disc Three
This is really me in a grade school play,
I had about a hundred thousand lines, but of course
I forgot &lsquo;em&#8221;</p>

<p>Disc Four
Never released before,
And you can tell why;
It&rsquo;s just some demos
I recorded in my basement.</p>

<p>Disc Five
I was barely alive,
I was coughing up a lung
So they had to use
A special computer as my replacement.</p>

<p>Disc Six
A dance remix,
So I can catch the latest trend
And it&rsquo;ll make you scratch your head
And wonder where my taste went.&#8221;</p>
