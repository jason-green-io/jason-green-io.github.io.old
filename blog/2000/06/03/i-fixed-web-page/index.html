<p>I fixed a web page for a club I had no idea exsisted, well, I knew it exsisted, just not that it had a web page.. not only that, but made by my good friend Mathieu Landry. I&rsquo;m joining, I&rsquo;m very intrested. I remember goin to UdeM and seeing the announcement on the billboard of the club&rsquo;s first meeting, but I never showed up, something came up, I don&rsquo;t remember, then it just slipped away into oblivion. But, now that it&rsquo;s been brought to my attention, I will surely not forget. In fact. I&rsquo;d like to be their webmaster :) Oh.. and participate. Here&rsquo;s the page: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/beausejournb/">Beaus√©jour Astronomy Club</a>. I am soo there. Ihave to tell you what I did tonight. I went to Au Deuxieme. And drank abit, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so typative. CHris Colepaugh and the Cosmic Crew were playing.. Brendan Furlotte opened. After the show Al and I went to Pita Pit, yummy. AL C. and Joe showed up, that was cool. Al C., BTW, got hired at CP. It&rsquo;s going to be awesome working with him. MMmm, this is one good pita! Al says he doesn&rsquo;t like cold pitas, but mine is still a bit warm. I eat cold food all the time.</p>
