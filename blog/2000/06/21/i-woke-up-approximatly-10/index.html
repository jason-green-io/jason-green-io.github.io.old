<p>I woke up approximatly 10 minutes ago. Why haven&rsquo;t I updated in such a long while you ask? What have been upto? What would make me ignore my fans like this? What&rsquo;s more important than typing on a keyboard? What would make a person do such a thing? Why would a person do such a thing? I&rsquo;ll tell you what. FREEDOM. I went hiking, I saw movies, I went shopping, I went rollerblading. Things I couldn&rsquo;t do while I was in college. Updates will be sparse during summer. Sorry.</p>
