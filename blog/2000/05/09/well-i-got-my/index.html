well, i got my palm to work, i can prove it.. i&rsquo;m using it now in the comfort of my own bed. i love it. i&rsquo;ll be updating like this alot more.. maybe even use the modem to update online while i&rsquo;m on the road. the batteries are doing very well, i love knowing that i&rsquo;ll always have power to give this little marvel of technology. my electric blanket is starting to warm up now, ahhhh now it&rsquo;s getting cozy. áàäâåãæçñøýßîïìíêëèéóòöôõúùüû that was me testing the international keyboard. the battery indicator says i used half of my .. battery, thats intresting.. oh well, a small price to pay for renewable power
