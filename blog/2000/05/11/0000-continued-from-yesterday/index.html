<p>My friend Al is having problems with elevators. I think he pressed the wrong button, or doesn&rsquo;t know how to operate one. Fireball whiskey, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

<p><strong>11:20</strong></p>

<p>I have come to a conclusion, there are no pictures of Fireball Whiskey on the internet. After an extensive search, I could find no pictures. I guess I have no math class, that&rsquo;s a good thing. An idiot in my class decided he steal a urinal saop thing an put it in class. Now it stinks, so no class.</p>
