<p>I should be sleeping. In the mornings, I wake up and.. let me rephrase that, I drag myself out of bed every morning and take a shower, show up for classes, and fall asleep (too many &ldquo;and&#8221;s in that sentence) I &#8220;digress&rdquo;. I love the convertible. I still need to get used to the touchy gas and the high clutch. In time, in time. I saw American Psycho again. Burn CD burn, writer inferno (I don&rsquo;t know about that last one, don&rsquo;t ask) Ever notice how people always say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask&rdquo;.. what if I wasn&rsquo;t going to ask, what if I understand you&rsquo;re saying gibberish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bye Bye, bye bye, I&rsquo;m doing this tonight, you&rsquo;re probably gonna start a fight, I know this can&rsquo;t be right. Hey baby come on. I love you endlessly, and you weren&rsquo;t there for me, so now it&rsquo;s time to leave and make it alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh.. what&rsquo;s that you ask, not many people will know.. I&rsquo;m sure at least one person will, this person will stay anonymous. Don&rsquo;t ask. From now on, I&rsquo;m no longer using &ldquo;br&#8221;s to delimit my text, I&rsquo;m using &#8220;p&#8221;s. I&rsquo;m gonna have to update my template.</p>
