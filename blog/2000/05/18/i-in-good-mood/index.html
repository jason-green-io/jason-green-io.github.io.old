<p>I&rsquo;m in a good mood today. I think it was the convertible ride yesterday. I got Mr. Noodles noodles cooling down and waiting for me to eat them. I also have left over Ruffles ripples chips and Ritz minis. I&rsquo;m all set for a pre supper time feast. Sorry I didn&rsquo;t update at college Al, I forgot. I&rsquo;m working tonight. I think I&rsquo;m going to love it. First bite of the noodles, too hot! I still have my MP3s playing randomly, at this moment, the song playing is Fred&rsquo;s 2000 Inch TV by Wierd Al Yankovick, awesome song. I can&rsquo;t wait to get my bass back, it&rsquo;s in the shop getting repaired.. I hope it comes out better than it did going in. I want to play. The neck was bent, I guess the reset it, and something was too high, so they filled, whatever. Puttin&#8217; On The Ritz Still too hot. Hey did&#8217;j&#8217;a hear, Mac OS X&rsquo;s release is being pushed back about 6 months. Not that most of you care, I do. Strong Enough Geez, still too hot, I did even have to put in my mouth, one noodle touched my lip and burned me. Fly From Heaven here&rsquo;s another one Hazy Shade Of Winter I just took a look at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wonderflur/">Wonderflur</a>, he&rsquo;s got a kick ass picture there, today. If it&rsquo;s not today, today, goto.. today in Al&rsquo;s calender. Turn Turn Turn</p>
