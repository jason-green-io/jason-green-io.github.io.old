<p>Well, I skipped my first day. Some people are actually dissapointed. Hm. Very busy at CPC today/night. I sold a personal record number of tickets. With the price changes I was only 2 dollars off. Not bat at all. I still don&rsquo;t have Wayne&rsquo;s CD. I said I&rsquo;d bring it to him Monday, what am I to do, I think I&rsquo;ll just assassinate Chris. I&rsquo;m craving soup in a styrofoam cup. Mmmmm. Styro-soup. Yves came, and left, was great seeing him again. I got a cool AOL 5.0 coaster I&rsquo;m going to use to put my styro-soup on. I can&rsquo;t find a picture of styro-soup.</p>

<p>I love lightning. It&rsquo;s so.. powerful, yet insignificant compared to the power of the Dark Side.</p>
