<p>Hello fellow humans. I have returned from the place called work. I saw a couple people I know tonight: Joker, Vero, Eric, Wayne, Camco Al, and many other I don&rsquo;t know personally. It&rsquo;s fun doing cash. My dad taped WWTBAM, that rocks! I got till Sunday off, that rocks! Yves is comming down Saturday, that rocks! We have a staff showing of Center Stage, that rocks! They&rsquo;re announcing great weather in the near future, that rocks! Alot of things rock! You have got to see this site <a href="http://www.moonboy.com/sms/index.htm">Science Made Stupid</a>, its sooooo funny and it rocks!</p>
