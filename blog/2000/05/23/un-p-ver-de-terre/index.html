<p>&ldquo;C&#8217;était un p&#8217;tit ver-de-terre qui traverse le trotoire, je le prend, je le ramansse, yuk, c&#8217;est dont ben déguelasse&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s Album du Peuple &ndash; Tome 3. I love it! Al C. dropped by. Was cool. My Palm won&rsquo;t turn on. Pisses me off. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do. Maybe bring it back to Future Shop, they may do something. I&rsquo;m out of Styrosoup, I&rsquo;ll need to get my mom to buy more. Yum. I didn&rsquo;t get paid today. My bass is ready, but I need cash. Damn holiday.. wait.. what am I saying.</p>
