<p>I just saw the video for Dancing Queen from ABBA Teens, I love it. I&rsquo;m very close to solving a Rubik&rsquo;s cube by myself (no help from a guide). Practice makes perfect. I&rsquo;m gonna go make myself styrosoup now. Done, yummy. Wow, Judith by a Perfect Circle has a really good video. First time I see it all on TV. It&rsquo;s alive, alive! The noodles in the cup are rising, slowly. mmm&hellip; This page is slipping, I noticed I&rsquo;m not updating as often as I was in April.. oh well :)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you baby, shakin&#8217; that ass, shakin&#8217; that ass, shakin&#8217; that ass&rdquo;</p>

<p>I just saw the coolest commercial, I have to go buy Jolt Cola. HAHA!! there it is again.. twice in less than a minute!</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart goes shalalalala shalalala in the morning, shalalalala shalala in the sunshine, shalalalala shalala in the in the evening, shalalalala shalalalala just for you.&rdquo;</p>
