<p>Lab, lab, lab. It&rsquo;s the lacation I&rsquo;m presently able to be found at. I have an entry on my Palm, but you&rsquo;ll only see it later on.. weird. It&rsquo;ll be like I&rsquo;m going in the past. I think I&rsquo;ll put Palm entries in <em>Italic</em> so as to give the user (you) an idea that it may not have been inserted chronologically. Now that I have rechargeables&hellip; well.. if I go on I&rsquo;d be repeating myself.. read up later on today. .. or.. forget this sentence if there&rsquo;s something on top.. actually.. you would have read it alr&hellip; oh NEVERMIND!</p>
