<p>something i just noticed.. my last palm entry had a time that was not properly formatted. not good. i&rsquo;m going to fix it.. by now you won&rsquo;t see it anymore. again, just as last night, i&rsquo;m waiting for my electric blanket to warm up. it is. i&rsquo;m not capitalising my words because its too time consuming. i just got a warning, my batteries are going to die, so i turned the backlight off and turned on the lamp.. i mean the lamp on the table next to my bed. battery seems fine now. i looked for software that would allow me to update with mr. palm here, but i couldn&rsquo;t find any. i may think of maybe learning how to program something for it, what an accomplishment that would be. i better go to bed now.. hehe, im in bed.. i better go to sleep now. wow, just now i ran out of power, i think it&rsquo;s the backlight, it sucks power very badly.

<p>this is becoming a ritual. writing in bed. i find it easier here. i&rsquo;m going to attempt to tell you all exactly what i did at work tonight. i got to crystal palace at around 17:35 with a bag of burger king food containing a large fry and a chicken sandwich, no cheese or bacon. i ate that and then put up the cinema checklists. i turned the lobby screen on. then i helped mitch with the deliveries. after that i selected posters i want and put them in a safe place. after that i did door. when people stopped comming in i put up all the new postrs we got: hollow man, rocky and bullwinkle, big mammas house, boys and girls and loser. then i went on break. came back from break, did checks, talked a bit to jeff. swept the main lobby. did door, saw stephanie. i shall contine tomorrow.
