<p>Oof. I had way to much fun tonight, not that that&rsquo;s a bad thing. I went to Cosmo with Nathalie and her friend Lynn. I met Roger and we went do Doc&rsquo;s looking for Caro, didn&rsquo;t find her, very dissapointing. TH reason for going was people from work were there, including Jenn and Jenn.. I danced with Jenn. Wayne gave me a free beer at Doc&rsquo;s. I think I have an entry on the <a href="27.html">27th</a> that I just put.. yeah.. I have the hicups, real bad.</p>
