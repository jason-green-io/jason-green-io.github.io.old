<p>Another month, another 30 1 days, I hope. I missed Who Wants to be a Millionaire&rsquo;s celebrity show. Damn! Hey, I just noticed Jadzia Dax from DS9 is on Becker, a show with Ted Danson. My mom drove the convertible with the top down. She asked me if I wanted to drive it, but I had to go work, that and I want to save my first time with Monique. .. rrright. Crystal Palace Cinemas got 2 new interact machines, and they&rsquo;ll be getting a slush machine. Becker&rsquo;s pretty funny. I like it. What a shocker. Now there&rsquo;s something else on TV. Family Law. Looks like a cool show. Hey! It&rsquo;s Captain Christopher Pike!</p>
