<p>There&rsquo;s this pain in my throat. It woke me up. I&rsquo;m gonna drink some water, and try to go back to sleep. If it&rsquo;s not better in the worning, I&rsquo;m going to have to skip work and take care of myself, sucky since I&rsquo;d be getting paid a WHOPPING 9$/hour. Sucks to be my throat.</p>
