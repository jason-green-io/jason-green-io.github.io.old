<p>I better get my fingers of of my nose and start writting something. Now, I wouldn&rsquo;t something like <a href="18.html">yesterday</a> happen again. That was a disaster. Well, what a dissapointment. Only after 30 minutes of me being online, someone decides to go to bed. Pfft.. Whatever. You know who you are! Yes you! Geez. I&rsquo;ll be going to bed early too, as soon as I&rsquo;m content about this page, actually. It&rsquo;s getting there. Mmm.. flat Sprite. I bought a nacho combo at my work place tonight. got Sprite, now it&rsquo;s flat. But still good. Someone found me on ICQ tonight. Betsey from Bathurst, cool chick. She&rsquo;s commin&#8217; down to Moncton in September to study. Alot of people do that, come here to study. I guess.. it&rsquo;s a good place to study. I mean, why not come here to study, I can&rsquo;t think of any reasons not to. Or &ldquo;not 2&rdquo;, reasons. It.. sounds alike, kind of. Rrrright. Mmm.. flat Sprite.. damn, said that already, but it&rsquo;s ok, because I say it every time I tak.. Mmm flat Sprite.. I take a drink. Mmm.. flat Sprite.. (bis) If I&rsquo;d have a scanner.. I&rsquo;d scan something and put it up here every day, kinda like the PVCSOTD, as Lou calls it. I don&rsquo;t blame him, typing the full title can accelerate <a href="http://danke.com/Orthodoc/carpaltunnel.html">Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</a>, and that&rsquo;s bad. I just though of putting more links on here.. but in case this page gets real popular (yeah right) and people decide to read all my past entries (yeah right, only I do that) I&rsquo;m not gonna put more.. because.. links die, it&rsquo;s part of life. But that one&rsquo;ll be there for awile.. and it won&rsquo;t have to point to anything in the future because everyone will know what Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is. (the whole computer taking over our lives thing will increase awareness, my opinion) I should start working on my theory of why humans are on this earth. it&rsquo;s long, and make perfect sense TO ME.. but I doubt society is ready for it :) Walking back from work I noticed how bulky my fleece and jacket are, it&rsquo;s the stuff</p>

<p>I put in them. I need a carry all, I&rsquo;m going for it! Before I go, I must find a song some suggested I listen to today.. lets see.. cmon Napster, don&rsquo;t fail me now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in&rdquo; &mdash; Morpheus</p>

<p>10KB/s I can do better.. 62.84KB/s THAT&rsquo;s more like it. Can&rsquo;t find the song.. getting something else.. domo arigato Mr. Roboto. I love that song.</p>
