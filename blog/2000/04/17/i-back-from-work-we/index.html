<p>I&rsquo;m back from work. We got a Titan A.E. standee. Marc and I put it together during the night, he started and I basically finished it. Just one little part left. I just finished talking to Mononcle Greg and Matante Jeanette in Iqualuit, Nuunavut. Not a Lynie in sight.. should I, shouldn&rsquo;t I call. I dunno. I thirsty, I jogged back from work, becasue I wanted to. Felt good. Now, dehydrated.. oh! I know what! I&rsquo;ll fill my platypus! (Don&rsquo;t ask if you haven&rsquo;t been keeping up to date) I love this site. <a href="http://www.iam.ca/">I am Canadian</a></p>
