<p>It&rsquo;s time to play, guess who wrote the quote.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life is the Universe&rsquo;s tendency to create patterns accidentally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Good luck, it&rsquo;s a hard one. So I got alot of sleep last, and I&rsquo;m very happy about that. I changed the way the page works, you shouldn&rsquo;t notice, but I sure the hell did.. I had to rename.. ALL the files.. and move them all around in different directories&hellip; oh and edit all the files too, forgot to mention that. If you find anything wrong, let me know. I&rsquo;m watchin Alien Nation.. very good show. Wow.. that was a shocker.. I won&rsquo;t get into it.. the reason I was mentioning it is because the Aliens (a ship of slaves landed something like 20 years ago and now they&rsquo;re part of our society) have a wierd replication system, the female keeps the &ldquo;pod&rdquo; and the males go thru the same pains as the female. Even the male children of the family. Very odd. I&rsquo;m kinda hungry, ate a box of KD, but I&rsquo;m still Hungary.</p>

<p>Hey,
I&rsquo;m not a lumberjack or a fur trader,
and I don&rsquo;t live in an igloo or eat blubber or own a dogslead,
and I don&rsquo;t know Jimmy, Sally or Suzy from Canada,
although I&rsquo;m certain they&rsquo;re really really nice.
I have a Prime Minister not a President.
I speak English and French, not American,
and I pronounce it a-bout not a-boot.
I can proudly sew my country&rsquo;s flag on my backpack.
I believe in peacekeeping not policing, diversity not assimilation,
and that the beaver is a truly proud and noble animal.
A tuque is a hat, a chesterfield IS a couch,
and it&rsquo;s pronounced zed, not zee, ZED.
Canada is the second largest land mass,
the first nation of hockey,
and the BEST part of North America.</p>

<p>My name is Joe, and I AM CANADIAN!</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The best CANADIAN commercial ever.</p>
