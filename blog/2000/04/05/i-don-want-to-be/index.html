<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be here. I&rsquo;m on break from a class I can&rsquo;t stop falling asleep in. Wilbur. eh? Ya got yer slow speakin&#8217; guy in front of the class, right, eh? And e&#8217; talks like this there, eh, right? Drives me crazy. I&rsquo;m going to Cosmo tonight. Gonna party like it&rsquo;s Wednesday, April 5th 2000. I can&rsquo;t wait to get home and try to figure out what the hell is going with the thing with the person and the stuff with the thing. Yeah.. Gibberish, don&rsquo;t ya love it. If it wasn&rsquo;t for chaos, we wouldn&rsquo;t know we exsist. Think about that.</p>
