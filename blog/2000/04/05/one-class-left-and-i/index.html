<p>One class left and I&rsquo;m outta here. Leo is commin&#8217; home with me, actually he&rsquo;s my drive, and we&rsquo;re gonna watch Star Wars Episode IV (4). I like refering to the original trilogy as episodes.. fits in better with the new one, and soon (4-5 years) new oneS. Some poor soul in here got his webpage changed by his friends because they found out his password. That&rsquo;ll never happen to me.. I always pick original passwords, right Ned, Al, Monique? whatever. &ldquo;Have you ever stared at it, marvelled at it&rsquo;s beauty, it&rsquo;s genius?&rdquo; I love that movie.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about my counter.. the number isn&rsquo;t even close to being accurate. 90 percent of those hits are me. I like to read what I write.. it entertains me.</p>
