<p>Hi Crimestoppers! Hi Steve! It&rsquo;s a Steve Martin routine. So I woke up about 1 hour ago, and I&rsquo;m here, home. I&rsquo;m taking the day off to catch up on sleep and assignments. Geez, I was thinking of something while I was in the shower, but now I forget.. damn! A this moment I&rsquo;m listening to Are you gonna go my way by Lenny Kravits.. sung by, get ready for this, Tom Jones and Robbie Williams. It&rsquo;s not too bad. I have many Tom Jones duets. Yes. I Do. Poor Hale Berry.</p>
