<p>I have returned from work. For those of you in the Moncton NB reigon, you will notice something different when seeing a movie at Crystal Palace Cinemas. The ushers over there now have to make announcements in front of presentations to promote our new &ldquo;Stash your Trash&rdquo; campaign. It doesn&rsquo;t work. Poor them. &ldquo;What we do is what you just can&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s a cool picture.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the Cigar Galaxy in Ursa Major, the red gas is hydrogen expulsed from a super stellar wind. I love it.</p>
