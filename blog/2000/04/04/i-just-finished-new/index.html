<p>I just finished the new layout, thanks for the idea for the new name Al, looks very good. I got rid of the guestbook, if you didn&rsquo;t know I had a guestbook.. well.. I didn&rsquo;t, I just said that so that it&rsquo;d would look like I had one.. but I really didn&rsquo;t (for those of you who knew I had one, well, I got rid of it) I think I should go eat now. &ldquo;You just walked in, I make you smile. It&rsquo;s cool, but you don&rsquo;t even know me. You take and inch, I ran a mile, can&rsquo;t win, you&rsquo;re always right behind me.&rdquo;</p>
