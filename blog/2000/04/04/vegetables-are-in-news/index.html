<p>Vegetables are in the news again. I don&rsquo;t want to get into it, too, odd. I&rsquo;m watching a very intresting Star Trek episode. It&rsquo;s the one where Beverley Crusher is the only person who notices everyone is disappearing. Very cool, well, cool for me. Hihihi. Wow, that lady can act, I never knew. I mean Gates Mcfadden.. Beverly Crusher.. right. Jean-Luc Picard dissapeared!! haha.. ok.. back to reality. Woohoo!! The Traveller.. sorry.. sorry.. back to reality. SO I have to go to work now right.. and I was writing this entry .. oh shit.. I have to go to work now.</p>
