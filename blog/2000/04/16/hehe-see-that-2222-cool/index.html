<p>Hehe,, see that.. 22:22.. cool. So I just got back from work. Fun day, Candace and I played hacky sack in box office for most of the day. even while we were serving tickets. Oh .. I gotta talk about last night. I had so much fun. Rick and Brendan were playing at Kramer&rsquo;s Corner (Brendan Furlotte kicks ass for those who don&rsquo;t know him.. and I think he kicks ass for those who don&rsquo;t know me) Al and I got a pitcher of draft and just hung out in the stairwell going up to Kramer&rsquo;s. I think it was his last gig in Moncton, he&rsquo;s gonna tour North America with <a href="http://www.colepaugh.com/">Chris Colepaugh and the Cosmic Crew</a>. He played kick ass stuff.. Al and I got ourselves another pitcher and we had a good time. Then Ned, Remi and the bachelor party.. party arrived! Woo!! We said our goodbyes to Brendan and then eventually landed here.. at my pad. Al and I kept drinking and talking, what a blast! Played 31. It&rsquo;s a card game.. like blackjack, but not. So that&rsquo;s last night. I&rsquo;m eating Jalapeno Humpty Dumpty potato chips. Yum, they&rsquo;re very good. Sorry about yesterday&rsquo;s entry, I know it wasn&rsquo;t very long.. but hey! I&rsquo;m the boss.. not that I think you think I&rsquo;m not.. I&rsquo;m just saying. Seems Caro is having computer trouble.. HAHAHAHA!! Sorry. I&rsquo;m listening to Brendan as we speak now.. ah.. I love it. Geez.. I don&rsquo;t know what to do right now.</p>
