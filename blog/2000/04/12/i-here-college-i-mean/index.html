<p>I&rsquo;m here, college I mean. It&rsquo;s snowing and I&rsquo;d rather be hiking in the Caledonia Mountains somewhere. With my natural gas stove and noodles up the wazoo. It&rsquo;d be so fun, I&rsquo;d bring my tent and I&rsquo;d sleep the night on top of Hayward Pinnacle. AH.. I need to go camping. I was browsing the Internet, actually, Al&rsquo;s old web page.. and I got to Lou&rsquo;s web page, then his links page, and to my link. It&rsquo;s not out dated.. but it&rsquo;s the old name! Greener Chronicles.. I forgot I named my web page that.. and I had made a logo and everything. It was sooo funny. And then this one time, at band camp&hellip;</p>
