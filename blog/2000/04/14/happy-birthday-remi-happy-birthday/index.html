<p>Happy birthday Remi, happy birthday Remi, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy brithday Remi. Just doesn&rsquo;t sound the same.. when typing it on a keyboard. Tonight, we&rsquo;re rocking the house.. the Pump House to be more precise. I had a Pepsi this morning, but it had no effect on me. I&rsquo;m still tired. In class today we experimented with paper airplanes. I got a &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; record breaking design, but we couldn&rsquo;t get it work.. well. I haven&rsquo;t eaten. I&rsquo;m debating if I should go to electronics class, it&rsquo;s starting in 15 minutes.. but it&rsquo;s Wilbur&hellip; eh? right? I might fall asleep, again. Mmmm.. I think I&rsquo;m going to try and download my ICQ database from home and install ICQ.. ask Al if he has eaten, or wants to eat.. if he&rsquo;s online. Go, or not to go. Hmmm.. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to go. Almost done getting ICQ working. This can&rsquo;t be.. looks like NO ONE is online.. not even the 4 people on my list who never turn their computers with Vibe off.. oh.. nevermind.. one of them is online&hellip; 2.. nevermind, it&rsquo;s working.. sorry. Al, go online. Oh well. I&rsquo;m taking off, heading to someplace with food, going to eat, something with grease.</p>
