<p>I&rsquo;m guarding Louis&#8217; CDRW, pretty cool thing, he&rsquo;s got the IDE cable sticking out of the case of a normal college computer lab computer. He&rsquo;s got direct CD installed. He got a RW disk in there. He got power connecter splitter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He got joo-joo eyeball he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please&rdquo;</p>
