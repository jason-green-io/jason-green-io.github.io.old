<p>My friend Eric has got his <a href="http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/edleblan/">webpage</a> updated. I love it, very talented artist, I really hope he gets noticed. I ate at the new Dairy Queen on Mountain Road today. The Bay opens May 2nd. Reid&rsquo;s newstand is now bigger. It&rsquo;s raining outside. Apple will one day rule the computer market. Writing unconnected things is easy. I like to play bass. I used to have a cat. I&rsquo;m going to listen to MP3s now. Enough of that. I Feel Fine by the Beatles..lets see if I can find the tab for that. hmm.. can&rsquo;t seem to find it. If you do, let me know!</p>
