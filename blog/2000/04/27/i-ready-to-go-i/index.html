<p>I&rsquo;m ready to go. I had, yet another, dream last night. I don&rsquo;t usually remember my dreams, but I&rsquo;ve been remembering them for the past 3 days now. I&rsquo;m actually wondering if it&rsquo;s a sign of some sort. One more and I&rsquo;ll have to do something about it. (nothing negative, more like preventative) I had problems with GeoCities last night, it wouldn&rsquo;t save the changes, well, it did. Freaky typos, missing times and all. So I fixed it 2 minutes ago. The bus leaves the mall at 9:30, but my Dad said he&rsquo;d drive me to college, so I can stay here for awile longer. Al updated <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wonderflur/">Wonderflur</a> last night.. or this morning I should say. Good work. He&rsquo;s also got a message board up, so go see his site and leve something behind, like a message or something, not banana peels or recycled egg cartons.</p>

<p>I was looking for picture of my bass, and I found this, close enough, you get the general idea.</p>
