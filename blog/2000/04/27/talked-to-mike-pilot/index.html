<p>Talked to Mike the pilot today. He explained everything I ever wanted to know about IFR, very intresting. I want to fly a plane. I&rsquo;m trying something new here at college. I usually carry around a big binder with all my notes for class, since I don&rsquo;t take notes, it&rsquo;s pointless, so now I have 3 transparent folder thingies and a transparent clip board thingy. I&rsquo;m happy with that, I feel a bit more organized. I want to go hiking, real bad! If it&rsquo;s nice out during the weekend, I&rsquo;m taking off. Gonna bring my stove, have a nice dinner next to Third Vault Falls or Laverty Falls, or maybe just at Kinnie Brook.. if I&rsquo;m real adventurous, I&rsquo;ll go right up Salmon River and have lunch at the swimming hole. Mmmm.. natural gas cooked Mr. Noodles.</p>
