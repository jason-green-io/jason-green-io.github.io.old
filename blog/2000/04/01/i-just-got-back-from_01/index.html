<p>I just got back from work! Yes!.. I was alone in box. Not fun, I served almost every single person who saw a movie today a Crystal Palace Cinemas, isn&rsquo;t that an odd fact. &ldquo;Looking for some happiness, but there is only loneliness to find&rdquo; an exerpt from a very cool song entitled Little Green Bag. I&rsquo;m listening to it now. Don&rsquo;t you just hate when people start saying something then pull back and not disclose what they were going to say. It&rsquo;s teasing, and I don&rsquo;t like teasing. Well, yeah I do, I do it all the time.. that&rsquo;s cuz I&rsquo;m a hoppopotimu&hellip;. I mean hipocrite. Hehe.. I&rsquo;m listening to S Club 7, again. Sorry :) Al left most of his CD collection here.. I can choose from many many cool albums&hellip; and I&rsquo;m listening to S CLub 7. Oh well. For the first time this morning, early this morning, I used the word onomatopoeia. I can&rsquo;t believe I remembered it, and it&rsquo;s meaning. I&rsquo;m very impressed with my uh.. umm.. the.. uhh.. words that I know how to use and remember. &ldquo;Everybody from side to side&rdquo; A female I know whom I work with got a call from MITI Friday, she sent in her resume once, 2 weeks ago, and got a call. I sent mine 4 days ago, and 3 times before that. Still no call. Ahhh!</p>
