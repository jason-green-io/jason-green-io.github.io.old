<p>Those Mr. Noodles sure were good, and the Pringles I had this afternoon were good too! Time for more orange juice. I like orange juice, it matches this page :).</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet we&rsquo;ve been together for a million years, and I&rsquo;ll bet we&rsquo;ll be together for a million more. Oh, it&rsquo;s like I started breathing on the night we kissed, and I can&rsquo;t remember what I ever did before. What would we do baby, without us, what would we do baby without us, and there ain&rsquo;t no nothing we can&rsquo;t love eachother thru, what would we do baby, without us, sha la la la.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a time for love and a time for livin. Take a chance and taste the wind. There&rsquo;s an open road and a road that&rsquo;s hidden, a brand new life around the bend. There were times, I lost a dream or two, found a trail, and at the end was you. There&rsquo;s a path you take and a path not taken, the choice is up to you my friend. The night are long but you might awaken, to a brand new life, a brand new life, a brand new life around the bend.&rdquo;</p>
