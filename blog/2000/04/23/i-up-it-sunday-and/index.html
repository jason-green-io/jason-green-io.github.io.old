<p>I&rsquo;m up, it&rsquo;s Sunday, and almost 10. Feels real good. Watched 28 Days with Caro last night, movie wasn&rsquo;t too bad, but not that great either. Later on I watched Star Trek: First Contact, what an awesome movie! Well, for a non-fan, I can imagine you&rsquo;re thinking&hellip; pfft, ya Star Trek.. well.. for a Star Trek movie.. it&rsquo;s very very good! I think I just hacked up a cat.. yuk.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite comic strips, it&rsquo;s sometimes hilarious. Most of the time it&rsquo;s, intresting.</p>
