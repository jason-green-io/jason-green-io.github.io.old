<p>I&rsquo;m back. And very glad to be. All of a sudden I need to download Faith by George Micheal. Ohh.. the I Am Canadian commercial, very cool. Now I&rsquo;m downloading Cotton Eye Joe I know what you&rsquo;re thinking.. wtf.. same here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the eagle flies with the dove, and if you can&rsquo;t be with the one you love, love the one you&rsquo;re with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I found a live version, and boy does it suck, they play it too fast.. off key and everything.. ouch, like they&rsquo;re rushed. My income tax return is here!! Woohoo!! now I can pay back all my friends!</p>
