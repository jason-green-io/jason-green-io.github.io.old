<p>I&rsquo;m having fun! I just finished talking to Chimene, got her curious :) I love getting people curious, but sometimes it&rsquo;s bad. My Christmas lights are on, Al&rsquo;s working on his page, I&rsquo;m helping him, giving him constructive criticism (so far, it&rsquo;s all good). I&rsquo;m eating Lay&rsquo;s sour cream and onion chips. Mmmm. The night is turnng out to be pretty cool. I should have music I like playing in the background.. sec.. Luck Be A Lady Tonight, ahh, Frank Sinatra, that&rsquo;s fresh, thanks Al :) Now I&rsquo;m waiting for a particular person to come online.. (toe tapping action is heard as Jason.. taps his toes on the ground) And Chimene is back. 3 minutes till.. yay.. I&rsquo;m so proud of myself. 1 week, I never would have imagined I could do this for 7 days.. and like it! Yes, I like it, very much!</p>
