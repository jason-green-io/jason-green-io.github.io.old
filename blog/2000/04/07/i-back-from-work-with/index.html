<p>I&rsquo;m back from work, with nothing to do. Pisses me off. I don&rsquo;t want to call anyone in case I wake someone up. And no one is online. Dammit, I hate it when this happens. I paged Al, still no response from him. I really want to do something. Ahhh!!!! Whatever, I&rsquo;ll just watch one of my movies and glance at the screen every 5 minutes until someone goes online, like I often do.</p>
