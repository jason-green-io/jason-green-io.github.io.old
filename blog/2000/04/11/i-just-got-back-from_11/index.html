<p>I just got back from a movie with Lyne. I loved it. Nick wants to buy a Mac, a 68030, probally an SI or an LC. Ya.. for 50 bucks.. ya.. well.. they make great doorstops. Great 50 dollar doorstops. Only The Lonely is playing, what a trip down memory lane. I remember hearing this song on CKCW back in M&#8217;Cook when I&rsquo;d wake up to go to school. Ahhh.. Roy Orbison, you spin me right round :) I hope Al and Ned are having fun in Freddy. I&rsquo;m sure they are.</p>
