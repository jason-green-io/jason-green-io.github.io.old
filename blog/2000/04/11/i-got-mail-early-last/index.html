<p>I got mail! Early last week I filled an application for info on Volkswagens, I got the info!&hellip; ahhh&hellip;. GTI GLX, my dream car. I also got info on all the other models. I&rsquo;m listening to Shakira, Estoi Aqui, I like the beat, don&rsquo;t understand any of the lyrics though. I still have that Pepsi bottle I was drinking this morning. eeeeuh.. it&rsquo;s flat.</p>

<p>Shakira not only can sing well, but she writes very very well too. I&rsquo;m reading translations to some of her songs, beautiful. Really!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sky is already tired to see the rain fall
And each day that passes is another like yesterday
I can&rsquo;t find any way to forget you because
To continue loving you is inevitable&rdquo;</p>

<p>My friends are going to Fredericton to party, must be nice. I&rsquo;d like to go, but I want to do the right thing, be responsible and show up for class, fall asleep, and come back here to do nothing. I think I may go see a movie tonight.</p>
