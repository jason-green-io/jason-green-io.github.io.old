<p>I just completed a test I didn&rsquo;t study for, from the looks of it, seems I passed. I&rsquo;m updating thru Geocities right now.. and I&rsquo;m using a different browser, Netscape 6, it&rsquo;s not bad at all. Still has a few bugs in it. It&rsquo;s only Preview Release 1 so it&rsquo;ll only get better. I like the new animation in the top right corner, very cool. I&rsquo;m drinking Pepsi, not supposed to because of my little heart condition.. but who cares, it&rsquo;s only my heart :)</p>
