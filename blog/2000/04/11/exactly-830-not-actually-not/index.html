<p>Exactly 8:30, not actually, not anymore. I woke up at 2:10 this morning, got water and checked to see if anyone was online. Someone was! Then I went back to bed. Didn&rsquo;t bother writing in here, I wanted to conserve my sleepiness so I could fall asleep faster. I&rsquo;m writing this on a piece of paper BTW. Gonna transfer it to digital with my fingers and a keyboard. It better not be cloudy tonight! I wish someone would reconsider doing something this week. Me wishing is me being hopful, but I&rsquo;m hopless so I guess it won&rsquo;t happen. What a mess.. there&rsquo;s confetti on the floor, of course, I put it there. Oops. Magic triggering pulses. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m learning right now. How fun. That&rsquo;s the name of my next mix cassette, Magic Triggering Pulses</p>
