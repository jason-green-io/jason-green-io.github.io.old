<p>I knew it&rsquo;d be a great idea putting this Daily thing on Yahoo!.. I can update it anywhere! I&rsquo;m in a lab right now, here at goodole NBCC Moncton. I can hear my stomach growling, I think I may go over at Sobeys and have slice of pizza soon. Dark Horizons says Matrix 2 and 3 will be again fillmed in Sydney Australia, yes!! Erin Brockovich still hasn&rsquo;t been beat at box office. I think I need to go see it. I&rsquo;m looking at other computer screens in here.. and I notice most of them have backgrounds from Maxim, I&rsquo;m not complaining, just an observation. Not suprising since most students in this department are 19-23 year old, computer litterate males. I&rsquo;m looking for a cool picture.. oh I have an idea..</p>

<p>There, that&rsquo;s a cool picture. I don&rsquo;t care if it doesn&rsquo;t belong in here, it&rsquo;s a cool picture. It&rsquo;s a photo of a an F-18 the moment it&rsquo;s breaking the sound barrier. The cloud around it is condensed water vapor in supercompressed air. Ned brought it tomy attention a couple months ago. It was in the Times Transcript actually, award winning photo by John Gay. Watch out pizza, here I come!</p>
