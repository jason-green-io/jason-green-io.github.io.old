<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a vegatable&rdquo; I had no idea THAT was in a Micheal Jackson song. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m listening to now, an old song called Wanna be Starting Something off of Thriller. I remember listening to that album days on end in the mid eighties. Specially this song.. a specific memory I have is when we had our old trailer, we were camping near a beach, and I had these Micheal Jackson books, everytime I&rsquo;d see them I&rsquo;d start singing in my head &ldquo;Mama se mama sa mamamacousa&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s at the end of the song). Brings back memories. I used to be a Micheal Jackson fan. Ahhh.. finally got it off my chest :) I ate more for supper, like I said I would. Hamburg, potatoes, corn and gravy.. mmmm. .. I like using &ldquo;double dots&rdquo; and &ldquo;quotations&rdquo; (and sometimes even partheses). And now for something completely different. <a href="pi.html">Pi</a></p>
