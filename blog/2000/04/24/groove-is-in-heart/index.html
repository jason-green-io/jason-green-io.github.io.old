<p>Groove is in the Heart is the first song I have learned by myself on a bass. It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m using to practice my speed and agility. I love it! Remi decided to start his own page, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/proremius/">Stuff in my Head</a>. If anyone else start his/her own online journal thing, I will have to severly beat them, it&rsquo;s become way out of hand! Notice the symbols on top, now it&rsquo;s illegal! Ha! Going to bed, I have a car tomorrow!! WOOHOO, I haven&rsquo;t had a car to go to college since, before way winter break.</p>
