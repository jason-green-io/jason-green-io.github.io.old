<p>That picture is of a car similar to the one we/I have in the garage (except it&rsquo;s red). Our new car, it rocks, my parental units got it cleaned today, droooll.. it&rsquo;s sooo nice. I get to drive it! Wooohooo!</p>

<p>So I just got back from work. I loved today, I was in such a good mood. Customers were laughing. I was giving the best customer service I&rsquo;ve giving since.. ever! I think I&rsquo;m going to drink orange juice. There.. mmmm. What was I typing, oh yeah! Work.. well, enough of work. I unpaused the song that was playing on my audio system&hellip; OZZY&rsquo;s No More Tears! Yeah! That song spins me right round!</p>
