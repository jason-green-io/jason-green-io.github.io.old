<p>I just finished fixing my aunt and uncles computer, again. Reinstalled Explorer 3.02.. hehehe.. I want to go out and have fun tonight. Don&rsquo;t care if I drink, don&rsquo;t care if I send alot of money.. as long as I have a s***load of fun! I think I&rsquo;m going to eat lunch now, since I haven&rsquo;t eaten.</p>
