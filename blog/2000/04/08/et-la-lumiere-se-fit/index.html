<p>Et la lumiere se fit! This evening was a bit eventful, talked alot to Joselle, something I haven&rsquo;t done in 4 months. She didn&rsquo;t say goodbye. Dammit! I&rsquo;m eating an apple. An apple. I don&rsquo;t eat apples, but I&rsquo;m eating one now. Odd isn&rsquo;t it. I&rsquo;m wearing my The Matrix hat, and listening to Let it Ride by BTO. Still no plans have been forseen in the future. (got some freaky verb tense stuff goin on in there). My platypus is empty.</p>
