<p>Scrap that, someone else gave me the answers.. not that I couldn&rsquo;t get them myself, just too lazy. Whatever.. here&rsquo;s an excellent quote I found:
&ldquo;There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere.&rdquo; &ndash; Isaac Asimov</p>

<p>I love it, got it here: <a href="http://www.quoteland.com/">quoteland.com</a>. Now I&rsquo;m bored. Got nothing to until 1. I think I&rsquo;ll just sit here and type. Don&rsquo;t got anthing else to do. (I&rsquo;m aware of the grammar in the last sentence.) I&rsquo;m still reading quotes. I&rsquo;m not going to post them though.. Some people reading would totally flip-out because I usually don&rsquo;t quote Robert Frost or Johann Christian Friedrich von Schiller (yeah right, as if I read anything from that last one). No mail, sad, dissapointing. Tomorrow is my first week anniversary with this &ldquo;daily thing&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m thinking of doing something special (said like the Church Lady). Woman Sues Nike Alleging Sneaker Made Her Fall ah hahahahahah! for 10 * 10<sup>6</sup> dollars! pfft. Ohhh.. the new full trailer for X-Men is out.. I&rsquo;m getting it now, I&rsquo;ll let you know what it&rsquo;s like.. ooh.. and I can play it in full screen becasue I&rsquo;m on a Pentium III.. ohh.. this should be good. Damn, I need to get Quicktime.. shouldn&rsquo;t take long.. but it&rsquo;ll take longer than what it would take me at home :).. sorry. Stupid download deamon. I hate those &ldquo;here is a program that&rsquo;s supposed to help you download stuff off the net&rdquo;. I think they&rsquo;re useless. Ok.. Got Quicktime, here goes. Ok.. it&rsquo;s loading.. very slowly. I can believe that.. the file size must be 50 MB. I have to wait till it&rsquo;s done downloading, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to ruin the suprise. I always do that. If I&rsquo;m downloading a trailer or something from a site that is kind of slow, I&rsquo;ll start watching it knowing it&rsquo;ll cut in the middle. I have to stop doing that. Still not done, I just though of something.. since this is the first dy the trailer is out.. chances are all those huge X-Men fans are probally all at their computers downloading it. That means they&rsquo;re bropally bringing the whole server down.. which would explain why my transfer rate is slow! Ahha! I need headphones, all the computers in the lab have sound cards but no speakers. (I&rsquo;ve always wondered what it would sound like in a lab with 50 computers with sound cards and 50 horny young male adults watching porn on them during class) Almost half done. I think I&rsquo;m going to put a picture a day.. it&rsquo;ll call it.. the picture of that day! Yeah! Or something that matched the name of this &ldquo;daily thing&rdquo;. If the text is from Ma Brain.. then.. a picture would be.. let me do a little reasearch.. I will call it..</p>
