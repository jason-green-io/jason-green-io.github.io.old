<p>I&rsquo;m sitting at home, in front of my computer with my Platypus. Let me explain. I&rsquo;m a bit of a hiker, one piece of equipement I have is a hydration system (wacky name for a bag of water). The one I have is called a platypus because of the shape of the valve at the end of the pipe. Difficult to explain. Anyway.. I got it filled with water and I have the &ldquo;platypus lips&rdquo; in my mouth as I type. I love it. I can drink water without using my hands. I&rsquo;m a bit tired, probally because of Cosmo. I have a good feeling I&rsquo;ll be heading to bed early tonight. Oh yeah.. that reminds me.. I have stuff to do with my palm. There.</p>
