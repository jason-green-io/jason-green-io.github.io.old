<p>Happy Canada day!</p>

<p>I got a new bed, about 2 days ago, it&rsquo;s huge compared to the one I had. It has a matching armoir thing.. or whatever. My bass playing is getting better. Thought I&rsquo;d give you an update on that. Right now I&rsquo;m going into Napster to get New Orleans is Sinking, a song I heard last night that I said I could learn on bass. Wow.. it&rsquo;s really easy.</p>
