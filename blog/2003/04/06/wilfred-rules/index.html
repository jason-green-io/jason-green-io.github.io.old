<p>I&rsquo;m hungry, it&rsquo;s early, I need caffeine and food. There&rsquo;s an idea.. Tim&rsquo;s should make caffeinated sandwiches. People could eat and stay alert days at a time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m back on vacation starting April 17th. I had alot of unused vacation that I had to use before May.</p>

<p>The third animatrix is up, called Detective Story, it tells the story of a detective hired to track down Trinity. Carrie-Ann Moss actually does the voice, very cool.</p>

<p>This ends my update.</p>
