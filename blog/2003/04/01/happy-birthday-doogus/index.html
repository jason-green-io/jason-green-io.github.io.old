<p>Back to work tonight/morning, yeehaw. At least now I have my m515, I&rsquo;ll be able to read Harry Potter! I have a feeling I&rsquo;ll be very very sleepy by 6:00, I&rsquo;m still a bit off of my actual work schedule, I should be back in the groove as soon as I wake up later today around 17:00. I love military time. Everyone should use 24 hour time.. it makes sense, less confusion.</p>

<p>Damn, I just noticed my Palm is empty, totally erased.. so no Harry Potter.</p>
