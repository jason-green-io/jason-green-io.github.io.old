<p>Hello, my first post <a href="http://picker.greener.ca">Picker</a> post. If you live under a rock, I did something with that 6100 Nic gave me, it&rsquo;s now a message board. Feel free to sign up and join in the kookiness. I&rsquo;m listening to Sarah McLachlan (I always have to look up her last name on google for the correct spelling, very sad). I&rsquo;m feeling a little nostalgic, even melancholic these days. I digress for now, but I&rsquo;m going to have to do something about that.</p>

<p>Snow, yes, we&rsquo;ve had alot of snow. 70cms people say. I refer you to <a href="http://picker.greener.ca/viewtopic.php?t=15">this</a> post. Scroll down, that&rsquo;s my car.</p>

<p>Well it&rsquo;s getting early, time for bed. S&#8217;ouaira.</p>
