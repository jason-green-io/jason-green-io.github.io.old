<p>I went to the Star Académie concert last night with a friend. What a show, I&rsquo;ve never seen so many people in the coliseum. They played most of the songs from the album (didn&rsquo;t play Amène toi chez nous). They did play some of my favorites like Dust in the Wind, Summer Nights, 1990 and .. get this .. Wilfred sang Réveil with Jean-François Breau, THAT was cool! All in all it was a very exciting night.</p>
