<p>I just got back from the Farmer&rsquo;s Market with my co-worker Mark.. I got me a quesdeilla and some spicy beef jerky .. and a french vanilla cap.. because I&rsquo;m very tired.</p>

<p>Monday, Ned and Moe came over, we watched the elections and a rubber band ball get dropped out of a plane, then we went to Doc&rsquo;s. Tuesday I went over at Joe&rsquo;s place with Al for video games, I just watched, then fell asleep on the floor. Wednesday, I know I went to Nav then Sport&rsquo;s Rock at some point with Ned and Monique.. but I don&rsquo;t remember how I got there. Thursday; Ned, Moe and I met up at Al&rsquo;s place for drinks and a bit of video games. Friday was martinis at brother Marc&rsquo;s place, we watched An Evening With Kevin Smith on TMN (it was TMN 5).</p>

<p>It took me 45 minutes to piece together the last 5 days.. my memory is getting suckier and suckier.</p>

<p>I went to the farmer&rsquo;s market about 1 hour ago and I bought some spicy beef jerky.. mm.. spicy beef jerky. Where&rsquo;d this french vanilla come from?</p>
