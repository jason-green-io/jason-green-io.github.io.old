<p>I&rsquo;m listening to Enter Sandman .. and I&rsquo;m wondering why I&rsquo;m single.</p>

<p>Oh.. did I mention I&rsquo;m drinking wine? No? Thought so.. well.. I&rsquo;m drinking wine. Went to Right Spot with Ned and Al to see an &ldquo;Albert County Jam&rdquo; Chris Colepaugh and others jammed till 2 am. It was quite extraordinary. I plan on going to St. Andrews to see Chris play on Canada Day.. which it so happens to be. I remember a few years back I actually included a Canadian flag in one of my posts.. perhaps you could search for it :)</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s the Beatles. I&rsquo;m using Ack&rsquo;s USB light.. Ack being the other Al.. geez.. I&rsquo;m really tied of saying Al.. I need some other way of distinguishing them.. and I wouldn&rsquo;t feel comfortable enough of thinking up an idea myself.. so I put this challenge to them. Find some way that I can name you guys so that people know which Al I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
