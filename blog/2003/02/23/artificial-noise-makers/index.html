<p>That was fun.. I just spent the last 45 minutes updating myself with <a href="http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/nibs/">Nic</a>&rsquo;s blog. If not all of you heard the news, Lynie has discontinued her blog.. it&rsquo;s a sad day for blogging. You wouldn&rsquo;t be reading this if it wasn&rsquo;t for her. Please join me in a moment of silence.</p>

<p>(moment of silence)</p>

<p>That is the cycle that is life, one less blog to read, one more blog to read. From death comes life.</p>

<p>Played cards with the usual gang Saturday-Sunday, Leo, Joe, Joker and I. I love playing cards.. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to have a card night.. every week.. something to look forward to. Our schedules never allow it happen that often, that&rsquo;s why Saturday-Sunday was great (Saturday-Sunday means midnight Sunday, I can&rsquo;t really say Saturday, even though most people associate that time of day to Saturday.. technically it&rsquo;s really Sunday. Work overnight and you&rsquo;ll understand what I&rsquo;m trying to explain.)</p>

<p>I need to watch a movie.. it&rsquo;s called <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0145547">Two Hands</a>, but I can&rsquo;t find it anywhere. I can buy it as a region 2 DVD at amazon.de.. but I&rsquo;d like to watch it before buying it.</p>

<p>I miss my Palm m515, I have a few dates I need to remember and I&rsquo;m forced to use paper to keep track of them, yuk.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.talonse.com/supergreg.swf">Supa Greeeeg, Numba 1!</a> There&rsquo;s a story behind that flash animation and it&rsquo;s quite suprising.. very very smart of Lee Jeans.. I won&rsquo;t put it here, I&rsquo;ll let you investigate.</p>
