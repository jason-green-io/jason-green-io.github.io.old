<p>p>Blogs are getting very popular, have you noticed? For fun I searched for &ldquo;blog moncton&rdquo; tons of results came up, some are blogs mentioning Moncton, alot are actually from Moncton.. a couple had been updated today February 21st.. I was amazed! One was from a 15 year old girl! Everybody is blogging, I ask why? Why has this become so popular. I&rsquo;m still trying to figure that out.</p>

<p>A few things I&rsquo;ve noticed.. when you have friends.. and you call each-other up, or IM or email or meet or whatever, you always ask &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s new?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; you want to be up to date with your friends&#8217; lives.. if your friend has a blog.. you read it.. there.. you&rsquo;re up to date. No point in asking what&rsquo;s up, it&rsquo;s all there. So .. are blogs taking away part of an aspect of friendship, or merely replacing the usual &ldquo;Oh nothing much&rdquo; answer to the standard &ldquo;What&rsquo;s new?&rdquo; question? Can&rsquo;t wait to see where this phenomenon is going.</p>
