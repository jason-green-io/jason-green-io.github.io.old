<p>I&rsquo;m back, SDF has found a new home. I can connect to it now, you will be able to soon, as soon as the domains get updated thru all the DNS servers, or at least your ISP&rsquo;s. I hear we had an ice storm recently, alot of people lost power, I didn&rsquo;t. I find that strange because I usually lose power very easily, a dense fog sometimes does it (not really, I exaggerated so you&rsquo;d get the point, if you don&rsquo;t well uhh.. too bad). I have a meeting to go to at 5:30, which sucks, because I&rsquo;m usually sleeping at that time, then I&rsquo;m working at 10:30.. after that, I&rsquo;m home free, off for 3 days.</p>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t gone out, probally tomorrow night.. if I wake up.. geez.</p>

<p>The short is out at <a href="http://www.thematrix.com">www.thematrix.com</a>, awesome, if you&rsquo;re interested in knowing the back story, go 4 it.</p>
