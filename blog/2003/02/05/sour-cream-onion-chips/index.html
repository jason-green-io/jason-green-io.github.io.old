<p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~shromie">She</a> rocks.. her site/email/&ldquo;whatever else SDF has to offer&rdquo; is also hosted by .. SDF. Damn I mentioned it twice.</p>

<p>I have nothing else to talk about, so I&rsquo;ll explain why my site was down.. SDF (Super Dimensional Fortress, from Macross) is a &ldquo;public access unix system&rdquo; .. meaning, it&rsquo;s a computer anyone can log into, create an account and host a site. SDF is actually 6 or 7 computers, all doing something different, they run NetBSD or something.. so these computers are in Seattle, in some room called a co-location. This room provides them with power, HVAC (Heating, ventilation, air conditioning) and power backup in case something happens. Well, the old provider.. the old co-location, kicked SDF out because allegedly SDF was being attacked by a DDoS (Distributed Denile of Service, basically, a &ldquo;cyber attack&rdquo;). So to protect their customers, they kick out SDF and breach the contract. Leaving 20000 people without email, web and other stuff for 3 days. The admin, my hero and idol, found a new co-location to house us. Costs more, but at least it&rsquo;s up and running. There are other details.. but I&rsquo;ll leave them out because they&rsquo;re pretty boring.. you can click <a href="http://www.lonestar.org">here</a> to know a bit more..</p>

<p>And now for something completely different.</p>
