<p>I pretty much just got back from a wonderful night at Paramount Lounge. 3 bands were playing, bands weren&rsquo;t that great, but being there with alot of different people was cool. No lights were on in the apartment when I got back, so I didn&rsquo;t bother turning any on. Kinda cool, the kitchen is illuminated by the light pollution Moncton emanates. The living room is pitch black except for the screen of my laptop and the USB light I borrowed from Al.</p>

<p>Listening to Alan Jackson, Alot About Living (yeah, I know, shut up)</p>

<p>I found my locker and I found my classes</p>

<p>Lost my lunch and I broke my glasses</p>

<p>That guy is huge! That girl is wailin&#8217;!</p>

<p>First day of school and I&rsquo;m already failing</p>

<p>This is me in grade nine, baby, this is me in grade nine</p>

<p>This is me in grade nine, baby, this is me in grade nine</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a blue-and-red Adidas bag and a humongous binder</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying my best not to look like a minor niner</p>

<p>I went out for the football team to prove that I&rsquo;m a man</p>

<p>I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t tell them that I like Duran Duran</p>

<p>This is me in grade nine, baby, this is me in grade nine</p>

<p>This is me in grade nine, baby, this is me in grade nine</p>

<p>Well half my friends are crazy and the others are depressed</p>

<p>And none of them can help me study for my math test</p>

<p>Got into the classroom and my knowledge was gone</p>

<p>Guess I should&rsquo;ve studied instead of watching Wrath of Khan</p>

<p>This is me in grade nine, baby, this is me in grade nine</p>

<p>This is me in grade nine, baby, this is me in grade nine</p>

<p>(Jim) They called me chicken legs</p>

<p>(Andy) They called me four-eyes</p>

<p>(Steve) They called me fatso</p>

<p>(Tyler) They called me buckwheat</p>

<p>(Ed) They called me Eddie</p>

<p>This is me in grade nine, baby, this is me in grade nine</p>

<p>This is me in grade nine, baby, this is me in grade nine</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a red leather tie and a pair of rugger pants</p>

<p>I put them on and I went to the high school dance</p>

<p>Dad said I have to be home by eleven</p>

<p>Aw man I&rsquo;m gonna miss Stairway to Heaven</p>

<p>This is me in grade nine, baby, this is me in grade nine</p>

<p>This is me in grade nine, baby, this is me in grade nine</p>
