<p>I bought some styro soup&hellip; and it&rsquo;s soooo gooood.. I hadn&rsquo;t had any in a long time.. if you you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about, search for it here, at the bottom (or top) of the page. Listening to Hello City. I saw How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days last night with Isabelle and Ad√®le, loved the movie, depressing though, but I won&rsquo;t go into details here. :) Need a glass of water.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go complete my Rubik&rsquo;s Cube now.</p>
