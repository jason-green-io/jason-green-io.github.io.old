<p>Long time, no blog! What up with me you ask? (or you may not ask, you might just be reading because you have nothing else to do and you don&rsquo;t care) My position at 644 main St. is being relocated to Newfoundland, I either have to move to NL or be laid off ergo find another position within xwave or abroad. See how I used &ldquo;ergo&rdquo; .. I&rsquo;ve been watching Matrix Reloaded, the Architect says that.</p>

<p>Everyone should check out Homestar Runner, I find that site very entertaining, but I&rsquo;ve discovered it&rsquo;s not for everyone, but I like non-sensical humor, and this stuff is the best.</p>

<p>The weather is getting more to my liking, for the past month the temperature up here has been constantly 30C. One of the trees in front is already losing it&rsquo;s leaves, it&rsquo;s stressed, it was the last to grow leaves, and crappy shriveled up ones at that.</p>

<p>Monique and I are renting a movie tonight, chepas quoi yet, we&rsquo;re going to decide there I think. I&rsquo;ve got some unused coupons at Roger&rsquo;s for stuff, not quite sure what deals I can get, hence the use of the generic term for unknown items: &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Congrats to Denis and Chantal and their new son Simon!</p>

<p>If you read <a href="http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/nibs/">NiC.net</a> then you are aware that I am currently in possession of a PowerMac 6100, I&rsquo;ve successfully installed <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> on it, it&rsquo;s amazing how a good OS (Windows being a bad OS .. don&rsquo;t even get me started about the recent worms and virii) can revive such old hardware.</p>

<p>Gonna install MovableType 2.64, wish me luck.</p>
