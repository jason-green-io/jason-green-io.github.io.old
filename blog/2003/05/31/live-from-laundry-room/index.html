<p>I&rsquo;m in my building&rsquo;s laundry room, connected to the internet throught my wireless Linksys router upstairs (4 floors). Quite amazing is reception I get down here.. I&rsquo;m getting the same reception here as I got in my bedroom at &ldquo;This Old House&rdquo;. The old house was made out of radiation absobing materials, so I never reaked the benifits of true wireless over the specified ranges that most wireless routers are advertised as providing. Did the grammar in that last sentence sense make?</p>

<p>Al C. and I started playing Enter the Matrix last night. Awesome stuff, I don&rsquo;t care for the in game cut scenes, but the cinematics are phenomenal, like watching another Matrix movie.</p>

<p>Here is a site that I find interesting. <a href="http://www.touchgraph.com/TGGoogleBrowser.html">Touchgraph</a>, make sure you have a Java capable browser.</p>

<p>Welp, the washer took about 27 minutes to finish a load, now to time the dryer.</p>
