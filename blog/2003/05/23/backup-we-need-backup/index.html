<p>I finally got around to MANUALLY adding some of my previous entries, I&rsquo;ve got about 100 left to go. That means I feel better posting in here again; I didn&rsquo;t like posting here because I knew it wasn&rsquo;t complete.. it was missing content and it was full of gaps. It&rsquo;s still missing content, from February 2002 &ndash; April 2000.</p>

<p>Anywho.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m moved into my new apt. only one person has visited me since I moved. I heard the buzzer for the first time yesterday. I&rsquo;ve got 4.5 shifts of workload left, that&rsquo;s 6 days 4 hours 56 minutes, give or take a few minutes.</p>

<p>I saw The Matrix: Reloaded 6 times so far, I give it 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, the grand prize, 10 out of 10 with cherries on top.</p>
