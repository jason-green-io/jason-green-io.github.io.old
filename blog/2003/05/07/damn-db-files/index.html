<p>Looks like I have new beginning, in more ways than one. My Berkeley DB files crapped out, meaning I basically have to start from the beginning. I still have all the old stuff stashed in a directory somewhere. I also got a new position at xwave, I&rsquo;ll be working in the Blue Cross center, finally out of the whole call center &ldquo;thing&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m also moving into a newer, nicer appartment closer to downtown (3 minutes walk to work).</p>
