<p>Starting the morning of the 11th, I&rsquo;m on vacation.. til April. I&rsquo;ve never taken a vacation before, should be interesting. I&rsquo;ll be going to college, so it&rsquo;s not 100% vacation.. but compared to work, college is going to be peanuts.</p>

<p>Still laptopless. Hoping to get some news today.</p>

<p>Got my m515 back.</p>

<p>Finished watching <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0081846">Cosmos</a> (btw, I bought Cosmos) .. it&rsquo;s the closest thing <em>I</em> can call a bible. I&rsquo;ll be buying and reading ALL of Carl Sagan&rsquo;s books. To give you an idea.. or a glimps of why I love Carl Sagan.. here&rsquo;s a quote.. not from Cosmos mind you. &ldquo;A celibate clergy is an especially good idea, because it tends to suppress any hereditary propensity toward fanaticism.&rdquo;</p>
