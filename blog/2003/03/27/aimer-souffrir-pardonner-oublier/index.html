<p>p>Good morning folks, welcome to my neglected blog. Since I can&rsquo;t sleep, I decided I&rsquo;d spend some time typing in here. Goin&#8217; to Woodstock tomorrow to party with Ned, Yves is down for a couple of weeks and he&rsquo;ll also be there.. we&rsquo;re going to party like it&rsquo;s 1998! Can&rsquo;t wait to get back on Saturday though.</p>

<p>How about that war eh?</p>

<p>I shovelled my drive way 2 days ago with some help, my car can now park in front my door. Roz and I hacked away at a huge icy bulge in the middle of the driveway for half an hour.. then we shoveled out a section of a drift.. it&rsquo;s great to park there again.. there&rsquo;s still a fair amount of ice there.. like a mini mount Carleton, but the car can go over it as easily as a penguin can traverse a sand dune. (I invented that last one, does it make sense? I don&rsquo;t think it does, but it&rsquo;s a nice contrast)</p>
