<p>I&rsquo;m still iBookless, brought it in last morning. So I watched half of the new Animatrix.. then my iBook froze.. I&rsquo;ll have to watch it somewhere else or wait.</p>

<p>I purchased an Afterburner kit for my GameBoy Advance. It adds a backlight, which doesn&rsquo;t come standard on a GameBoy Advance. So.. that means i can play Tetris in the dark, yes!!!</p>

<p>Weekend off, I have 7.5 hours left, w00t. Nic&rsquo;s got something planned for Friday, not quite sure what yet, but I&rsquo;m in!</p>
