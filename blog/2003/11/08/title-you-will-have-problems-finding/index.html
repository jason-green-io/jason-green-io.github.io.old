<p>So I went to Cosmo tonight, alone for a while but then an angel called me and asked if she could join me.. before I go on I need to mention I was just listening to the theme to Encounters of the Third Kind .. back to the blog.. even though Anything But Ordinary by Avril is playing :) .. uhhh.. yeah.. the blog.. so I had a great time at Cosmo, I get back home and I download the first episode from the new animated series from Lucasfilm: Clone Wars .. drawn by the same people as Samurai Jack .. sorry for the people who think I&rsquo;m linking these titles.. but I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re going to google these names.. so I&rsquo;m not worried.. and if you don&rsquo;t know what googling is.. you better log off and throw your computer out the window .. .. please.. no.. really. So the cartoon is AWESOME, see it if you&rsquo;re a Star Wars fan. I had a little incident with champagne.. I was searching all over for a reason to open a bottle of champagne my cousin gave me.. I even went out of my and her way in contacting an &ldquo;ex&rdquo; co-worker.. someone whom I could trust to have a reason for me celebrate.. and she came thru :) and then another reason appeared, but the champagne sucks.. too old or not chilled.. so I&rsquo;ll keep to myself.. which I&rsquo;m totally comfortable with :) Now I&rsquo;m listening to Alan jackson.. entertainer of the year in the country category.. Mathieu Landry had his initials as part of his MSN name for a few days.. I remember asking him if he was still into country.. and he said he wasn&rsquo;t inot that stuff anymore.. but he still had AJ mentioned in his name .. Moose is country to the bone.. even if he&rsquo;s helping to design the latest in areospace engineering :)</p>

<p>Time for another paragraph.. and time for a Bois Joli quote: &ldquo;Dan&#8217;le fond tou&#8217;ce qui veut c&#8217;est boire, l&#8217;innocent du samedi soir&rdquo; .. boys oh boys, time pour la section chiac de mon entry. Chepas quoi trop dire, j&#8217;ai deja dit pretty much ça j&#8217;avait a dire en anglais.. j&#8217;ai ajouter toute mes &ldquo;archives&rdquo; a la fin de s&#8217;ta page icitte so que google le pick up pis que que everyone peuvent searcher every single post que j&#8217;ai fait.. c&#8217;est kinda cool, google est updater..
