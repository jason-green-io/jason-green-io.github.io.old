<p>Holy crap.. I was bored tonight so I decide to go to Cosmo, like I usually do. Alone. Seems like Rev has a new flavor, called Red. So I have a few drinks, Keith&rsquo;s (2 for one before 11), then I decide to dip into the Rev, the new one. So I&rsquo;m standing there right. Waiting to get served.. the bartender comes up and asks what I want, I say, &ldquo;a Rev, the new one&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s a cute girl next to me, so I get chatting. The bartender passes me my drink, and the girl says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re drinking Rev?&rdquo;, I say &ldquo;ya!&rdquo;.. she says &ldquo;a guy should not drink Rev&rdquo; and goes on explaining that she would never hook up with a guy who drinks Rev.. I&rsquo;m .. kinda offended.. I say, &ldquo;there are laws in Canada that say that I can drink whatever I want&rdquo; .. and she leaves. Bla bla bla.. I sit at their table (it&rsquo;s hard to compress everyhting that happened in one little paragraph) and we go dancing.. last call is called, the music stops, and I get to find out who this girl is.. from Cocagne.. yes.. and she knows who Sebastien and all of them are.. this sets me back.. obviously.. and all I can think of is.. .. Cocagne REALLY is the center of the Universe.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is .. if you want your life to get exciting, quick, drink Rev.</p>
