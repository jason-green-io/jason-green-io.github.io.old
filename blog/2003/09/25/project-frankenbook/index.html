<p>As many of you know, I used to own a 466 MHz clamshell iBook SE which I sold to Lynie. The poor laptop has been thru alot, it&rsquo;s battery died a few months back so I ordered a new batttery for it.. then the yo-yo AC adapter died (all of them do eventually), so I found one at Ivan&rsquo;s. Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s underside was starting to peel off due to heat.</p>

<p>The poor thing had 9 lives, it&rsquo;s down to .. I&rsquo;d say .. 3 now. Last week it&rsquo;s modem died. So Lynie brought it to Ivan&rsquo;s Camera (they sell Macs) to troubleshoot, they wanted to reinstall the OS or something so she asked me to backup her data.. knowing I could troublshoot better than they could, I attacked the problem.. booted off various OSs and noticed the modem would not run in any of them. Harware issue, end of subject. I begin surgery on the suffering piece of technology, using <a href="http://caslis.com/mac/ibook/ibdrive.html">this</a> site.</p>

<p>I notice the modem isn&rsquo;t seated properly so I pushed it in and reassembled.. at that point I was eager to try it out. I was impatient in putting it back together which caused me to rip the trackpad cable in two. Crap. I plug in a mouse, try the modem, still no go. Double Crap.</p>

<p>I tell this to Paul, the Ivan&rsquo;s Camera Mac guy.. he agrees it&rsquo;s a hardware problem and suggests I fix it myself by buying an old 333MHz iBook that has a bad LCD and use it for parts. So Lyne buys the thing, and I begin an adventure.</p>

<p>So the plan was to transfer Lyne&rsquo;s iBook innards to the old iBook&rsquo;s case, use the old iBook&rsquo;s modem and drill a hole in the old iBook&rsquo;s case for the FireWire port (original iBooks didn&rsquo;t come with FireWire).</p>

<p>I start by taking the old one apart.</p>

<p>Then Lynie&rsquo;s</p>

<p>Then I had to get the old base ready for Roz&rsquo;s dremel&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;by marking where the firewire port is supposed to be.</p>

<p>After a quick trip to Roz&rsquo;s I get back and complete the work, I transfer the old guts into the old case.. or the new case.. or is it.. anyway, I moved stuff around and ended up with this:</p>

<p>I like the extra translucency of the old style case. I also kept the old keyboard, looks better than the other one.. so anyway.. this is how the dremel work ended up:</p>

<p>For anyone attempting to do this .. don&rsquo;t, save up for a shiny new iBook or 12&#8221; PowerBook.</p>
