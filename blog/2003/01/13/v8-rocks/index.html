<p>p>So I&rsquo;m sitting there right.. and I&rsquo;m really thirsty, but my usual water bottle with the letters inked in red marker spelling &ldquo;Greener&rdquo; is no where to be found. So then it hits me, like most things do at 6:00, I have 2 cans of V8 in the fridge. Cold V8 is wonderful. It&rsquo;s like drinking solid food. You feel your stomach is full when you drink V8. I love V8.</p>

<p>I have my iBook here at work.. but it&rsquo;s not connected to the net. I wish it was. I hate using windows. My neck hurts.. not quite sure why.. and I think I have an ear infection. Every time I have a burb/spasm, my left ear pains me. I&rsquo;ll let it go a few days and if it&rsquo;s still bad, I&rsquo;ll get it checked.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m done both cans, but I&rsquo;m still thirsty. I&rsquo;m going to go fill the cans with water. I just thought of something interesting, they have bottle water.. why don&rsquo;t they have canned water? I&rsquo;m sure there must be a perfectly good explanation. That&rsquo;ll give me something to do, after I fill my cans with water. Wow.. is it ever weird drinking water out of a can.. if you&rsquo;ve never tried it.. do. And now the search begins for canned water. OMG</p>

<p>Canned water, who would have thunk it. I stand corrected. I&rsquo;d love to have a case full of that stuff! Rejean doesn&rsquo;t like V8. The water in the can mixed in a bit with the V8, so it&rsquo;s V8 tasting water.. or diluted V8, mmmm diluted V8.</p>
