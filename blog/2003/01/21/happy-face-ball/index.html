<p>I have a foam ball with a happy face on it that I&rsquo;ve had at work for about a year now. For some reason it was out of the drawer today. Someone is playing with my happy face ball.</p>

<p>Funny line from Joker over heads up. (Heads up is our internal instant messenger software.)</p>

<p>HAHAHA, from Dark Horizons: &ldquo;Die Hard 4: Die Hardest: The Mirror and Hello reports that Britney Spears is up for the role of Bruce Willis&#8217; daughter whom has to be rescued from kidnappers.&rdquo;</p>
