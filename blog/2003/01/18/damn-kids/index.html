<p>My landlord gets his kids every weekend. Now that I&rsquo;m on the graveyard shift, this is very annoying. All day, while I was trying to sleep, I heard kids seemingly running back and forth on the second floor. I did manage to fall asleep a few times, and between 19:03 and 21:00 it was great, they weren&rsquo;t there. Then they arrived and I had to wake up and go to work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working on the site design, I&rsquo;m having difficulties making it look good in all browsers. Why can&rsquo;t everybody get along and use the same standard (Microsoft). I&rsquo;m posting now so it appears the 18th.</p>
