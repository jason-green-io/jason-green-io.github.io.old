<p>I played Contra: Shattered Soldier 12 hours straight this morning. I dreamt of Contra today, and I plan on playing more tonight.</p>

<p>I redesigned the site again, making the blog.. THE site. I&rsquo;ll figure out a way to get the galleries back, but I&rsquo;m not rushed. Now I need to take a shower, eat and play Contra. Gonna need some munchies and more pop. I also need a new 30W bulb for one of my lamps. Can&rsquo;t wait to get paid, I have a list of stuff I&rsquo;m going to buy for my kitchen, so I can start cooking. (keep the &ldquo;yeah right&rdquo; commentaries to yourselves, in fact, I&rsquo;m going disable comments on this one, ha!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to take a picture now, of something random and put it up.</p>
