<p>Starting next Friday I&rsquo;ll be on the graveyard shift. My shift will be 2230 to 0900. Can&rsquo;t wait to see if I can adjust. I pretty sure I can, I&rsquo;m a very adaptive human being. The forest fire smell has dissipated, I didn&rsquo;t smell anything when I arrived from work last night. I kinda liked the smell, reminded me of camp fires and the great outdoors.</p>

<p>For all you Mac OS X users out there, don&rsquo;t forget to download Safari, Apple&rsquo;s new browser. It features built in spell check.. a life saver for me and the last post I made.</p>
