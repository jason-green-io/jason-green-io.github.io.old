<p>S in 1, S in 2, A in 3, A in 4 and C in 5.. that gives us 6. Level six is indescribable.. it&rsquo;s really really cool. We&rsquo;ll be able to get an A in that pretty soon. (I&rsquo;m talking about Contra, I&rsquo;m in an another marathon) Al pointed out I missed another day.. I did, sadly. But my constant flow of entries is a significant improvement over last year. If I can keep it up for 2003, I might actually attract more readers. naaaa.. if I&rsquo;d want to attract more readers my writing would have to be least on par with Al&rsquo;s, if not Lynie&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>I currently look like a real hardcore geek, I haven&rsquo;t shaved in a week, I&rsquo;m wearing my ripped &ldquo;got root?&rdquo; t-shirt, with a white t-shirt underneath, green multi-pocket-convertible pants, my Matrix hat and a timex watch.. w00t w00t. All I need is a can of Dr. Pepper in my hand.</p>

<p>Al gave me his serrated bread knife, one less kitchen utensil I need to buy, thank you! I got a battery for my Photon light, it was dead.. I bought the battery at Radio Shack, I was at the mall at 9:30 not knowing the stores only open at 10:00. It came with a warranty, if it goes dead within 3 years they&rsquo;ll give me 2 free new ones. It&rsquo;s a good deal, but I&rsquo;m sure there something behind that that I don&rsquo;t know. Damn corporations and their seemingly amazing service.</p>
