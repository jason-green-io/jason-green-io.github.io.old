<p>Great scott!!! Have you seen the Matrix Reloaded trailer! Brought a tear to my eye, I&rsquo;ve never been more excited to see a movie, Star Wars or Lord of the Rings don&rsquo;t come close. I am so there the first 3-5 showings. Nothing will keep me away.</p>

<p>10 on call 46 waiting. Geez it&rsquo;s noisy in here.</p>

<p>My last entry generated some pretty interesting comments, woohoo! I should talk about more controversial subjects. Like.. Macs are better than PCs.. wait, that won&rsquo;t work, most everybody who reads this owns a Mac&hellip; or do they&hellip;</p>
