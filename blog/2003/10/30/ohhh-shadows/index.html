<p>Safari 1.1 (that&rsquo;s a browser in OS X, 10.3 actually) supports drop shadows thru CSS2. Very cool stuff, if you visit my site with Safari 1.1, you&rsquo;ll notice nice shadows, w00t. For people who don&rsquo;t have CSS2 browsers (poor Windows people and older versions of Safari or Mozilla.. or whatever else you use) tough!</p>
