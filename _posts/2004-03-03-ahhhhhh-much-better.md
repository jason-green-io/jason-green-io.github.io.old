I'm making a few cosmetic changes to the site. I added a sidebar, as you can see, and a link to syndicate my blog. If you have no idea what I mean by "syndicate", read [this][1].

Tonight I'm hopfully going out with Ned and Monique, Ned's in Moncton for spring break, or as I like to call it: ressort casse.

My work "day" is coming to an end. Print went very well tonight. Since we switched printers, we've been getting less jams .. ! .. in fact, I didn't get a jam tonight! That has to be a first! I didn't get any papercuts either, but that's because my hands are used to them now, they've developped a thik layer of paper resistant skin. .. or something.

I think I'm going to buy a car this spring; a 2004 Toyota Echo hatchback. Stop laughing, they're good cars.

Lost in a dream
Don't know which way to go
If you are all that you seem
Then baby I'm moving way too slow
I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught
In the slammin' door
How about some information--please
Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh
Or am I caught in a hit and run
Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh
Are you just having fun
Time's standing still
Waiting for some small clue
I keep getting chills
When I think your love is true
I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught
In the slammin' door
How about some information--please
Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh
Or am I caught in a hit and run
Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh
Are you just having fun
You are so hard to read
You play hide and seek
With your true intentions
If you're only playing games
I'll just have to say--bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
Do do you love me
Do do you love me
Do do you love me
Do do you love me
I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught
In the slammin' door
Are you more than hot for me
Or am I a page in your history-book
I don't mean to make demands
But the word and the deed go hand in hand
How about some information--please
Chorus cont.
I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught
In the slammin' door
Are you more than hot for me
Or am I a page in your history-book
I don't mean to make demands
But the word and the deed go hand in hand
How about some information--please
Chorus out
