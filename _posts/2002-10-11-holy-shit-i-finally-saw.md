Holy shit, I finally saw it.. I decided I'd go to MTV.com, see if I could find something decent to download, checked the top 20 videos.. and I said to myself "oh, Jimmy Fallon, that should be funny".. and it was, a bit. So I head on over the the TRL top 10 section.. and there is was at number 2.. I click on the little TV, I watch the thing, and now I'm scarred for life.
