I'm going out tonight, probally Cosmo. I bought Dr. Pepper and I'll be visiting my friend Jack D. I'm going to try the combination, like a test. Should be an interesting mix. I dropped my iPod this morning, no worries, it works fine, but the wheel came off, I was able to see how the wheel and clicker worked, interesting stuff, I put it back together, it snapped right back into place, I should have taken a picture.

Listening to Across the Universe sung by Fiona Apple, originally, it's a Beatles tune. Sung past tense, like the guy everyone was saying Veronica was going to marry.

"Doo-doo doo doo-doo, doo-doo doo doo-doo, doo-doo doo doo-doo, doo-doo doo doo-doo"
