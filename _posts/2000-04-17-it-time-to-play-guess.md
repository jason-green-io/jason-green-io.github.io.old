It's time to play, guess who wrote the quote.

"Life is the Universe's tendency to create patterns accidentally."

Good luck, it's a hard one. So I got alot of sleep last, and I'm very happy about that. I changed the way the page works, you shouldn't notice, but I sure the hell did.. I had to rename.. ALL the files.. and move them all around in different directories... oh and edit all the files too, forgot to mention that. If you find anything wrong, let me know. I'm watchin Alien Nation.. very good show. Wow.. that was a shocker.. I won't get into it.. the reason I was mentioning it is because the Aliens (a ship of slaves landed something like 20 years ago and now they're part of our society) have a wierd replication system, the female keeps the "pod" and the males go thru the same pains as the female. Even the male children of the family. Very odd. I'm kinda hungry, ate a box of KD, but I'm still Hungary.

Hey,
I'm not a lumberjack or a fur trader,
and I don't live in an igloo or eat blubber or own a dogslead,
and I don't know Jimmy, Sally or Suzy from Canada,
although I'm certain they're really really nice.
I have a Prime Minister not a President.
I speak English and French, not American,
and I pronounce it a-bout not a-boot.
I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack.
I believe in peacekeeping not policing, diversity not assimilation,
and that the beaver is a truly proud and noble animal.
A tuque is a hat, a chesterfield IS a couch,
and it's pronounced zed, not zee, ZED.
Canada is the second largest land mass,
the first nation of hockey,
and the BEST part of North America.

My name is Joe, and I AM CANADIAN!

Thank you.

The best CANADIAN commercial ever.
