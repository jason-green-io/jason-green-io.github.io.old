Great scott!!! Have you seen the Matrix Reloaded trailer! Brought a tear to my eye, I've never been more excited to see a movie, Star Wars or Lord of the Rings don't come close. I am so there the first 3-5 showings. Nothing will keep me away.





10 on call 46 waiting. Geez it's noisy in here.





My last entry generated some pretty interesting comments, woohoo! I should talk about more controversial subjects. Like.. Macs are better than PCs.. wait, that won't work, most everybody who reads this owns a Mac... or do they...
