Disc One
It's where we've begun, it's all my greatest hits,
And if you are a fan then you know that you've
already got 'em

Disc Two
It was all brand new, and album's worth of songs,
but we had to leave the whole disc blank because
Some other label bought 'em

Disc Three
This is really me in a grade school play,
I had about a hundred thousand lines, but of course
I forgot 'em"

(...)

Disc Four
Never released before,
And you can tell why;
It's just some demos
I recorded in my basement.

Disc Five
I was barely alive,
I was coughing up a lung
So they had to use
A special computer as my replacement.

Disc Six
A dance remix,
So I can catch the latest trend
And it'll make you scratch your head
And wonder where my taste went."
