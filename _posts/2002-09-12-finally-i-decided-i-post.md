i am in my bed, sick. i have a cold. and i'm typing on my palm pilot. i have a little story to tell about my palm pilot. i once had a palm iii c.. but i broke, so ibrought it back to the store, and they wanted to give me a new one that would not have replaced my old one. so i paid more and got a palm m515. it's sweet, it rocks!! that's my story.
