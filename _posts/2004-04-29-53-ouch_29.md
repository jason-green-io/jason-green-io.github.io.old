So I'm at .. umm .. 9 now. the list still isn't even complete, I'm writing posts as I'm finding stuff to put on the list. 9 down, 44 to go .. geez that sounds painful. What have I gotten myself into! Thing is.. I do have ALL DAY to post 44 entries .. I'd like to finish a big chunk tonight so I can wake up, do stuff and post about it .. then I'll be done. Ohhh.. forgot I had chips in the drawer, I'm going to eat those as I try to think of more things to put on the list.
