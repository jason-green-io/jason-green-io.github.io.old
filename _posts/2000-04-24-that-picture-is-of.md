That picture is of a car similar to the one we/I have in the garage (except it's red). Our new car, it rocks, my parental units got it cleaned today, droooll.. it's sooo nice. I get to drive it! Wooohooo!

So I just got back from work. I loved today, I was in such a good mood. Customers were laughing. I was giving the best customer service I've giving since.. ever! I think I'm going to drink orange juice. There.. mmmm. What was I typing, oh yeah! Work.. well, enough of work. I unpaused the song that was playing on my audio system... OZZY's No More Tears! Yeah! That song spins me right round!
