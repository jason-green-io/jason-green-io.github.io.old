Tonight was a night filled of a whole lotta nothing, watched TSS, a bit of Frantic starring Harrison Ford, then bed (my current location). I'm typing in the dark.. and I'm actually hitting the keys I'm supposed to be hitting. Pretty cool, next thing you know, I won't need to look at the keyboard. I love cheese. Currently listening to Good Day Sunshine, good Beatles tune. But it's not playing anymore. "Baby when I heard you, for the first time I knew, we were meant to be as one"
