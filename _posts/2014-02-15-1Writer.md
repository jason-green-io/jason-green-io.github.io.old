I've been a fan of Daedalus for about a month, even with its shortcomings (its got Dropbox bugs, visual glitches and writes a [BOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) that octopress doesn't like). Last night I was looking for something else, other than Byword; which is nice, but still just doesn't do it for me. I found [1Writer](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/1writer-note-taking-writing/id680469088?mt=8). I really like it. Simple, it has all the features of Byword and more. The more I use it the more I like it. Related to [this](/blog/2014/02/15/Dropbox-user-content) post, 1Writer will automatically upload and link dropbox files for you, whaaaat! It's universal, it's **very** nice on the iPad. Crazy amount of fonts, if you're into fonts. If you're looking for a markdown preview/authoring, dropbox saving, nice looking, universal, inexpensive, app .. Download 1Writer.
