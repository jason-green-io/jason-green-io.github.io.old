This is old:

Where Did You Come From Lady
And Ooh Won’t You Take Me There
Right Away Won’t You Baby
Tendoroni You’ve Got To Be
Spark My Nature
Sugar Fly With Me
Don’t You Know Now
Is The Perfect Time
We Can Make It Right
Hit The City Lights
Then Tonight Ease The Lovin’ Pain
Let Me Take You To The Max

Wow. That brought me way back.
