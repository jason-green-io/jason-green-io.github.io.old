Yes, drunken TP is the best game ever. Ned, Lyne and I played a round .. I won by .. hehe .. default, since Doyle arrived and we needed to start another game. Lynie and I paired up to become the ass kicking Trivial Pursuit winning team we always imagined we'd be. We won .. of course. Tcheu fun! We rule!
