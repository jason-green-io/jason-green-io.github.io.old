My landlord gets his kids every weekend. Now that I'm on the graveyard shift, this is very annoying. All day, while I was trying to sleep, I heard kids seemingly running back and forth on the second floor. I did manage to fall asleep a few times, and between 19:03 and 21:00 it was great, they weren't there. Then they arrived and I had to wake up and go to work.





I'm still working on the site design, I'm having difficulties making it look good in all browsers. Why can't everybody get along and use the same standard (Microsoft). I'm posting now so it appears the 18th.
