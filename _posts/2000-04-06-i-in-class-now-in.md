I'm in class now.. in front of a computer, with a keyboard. Our instructor just handed us an assignment, yes! It's an easy course, I'll have it done before I leave college. Right! So.. Cosmo! I actually spent most of the time upstairs, which is totally unlike me. I danced, which is totally unlike me. The things alcohol does to your brain. I have to reboot the machine I'm on and go in DOS to finish the assignment.
