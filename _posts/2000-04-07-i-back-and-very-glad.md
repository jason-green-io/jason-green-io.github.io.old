I'm back. And very glad to be. All of a sudden I need to download Faith by George Micheal. Ohh.. the I Am Canadian commercial, very cool. Now I'm downloading Cotton Eye Joe I know what you're thinking.. wtf.. same here.

"And the eagle flies with the dove, and if you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with."

I found a live version, and boy does it suck, they play it too fast.. off key and everything.. ouch, like they're rushed. My income tax return is here!! Woohoo!! now I can pay back all my friends!
