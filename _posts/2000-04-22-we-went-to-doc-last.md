We went to Doc's last night. There's wasn't anywhere to sit downstairs, so we went upstairs, to our suprise, Brigitte and Sharon were there, and Wayne was bartending! Woohoo.. so we stayed there till close, talked to Wayne, consumed alcohol, and walked home. We had a blast walking home! Something tells me I may be doing it all over again tonight.
