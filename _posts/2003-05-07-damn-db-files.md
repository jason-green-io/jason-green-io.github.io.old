Looks like I have new beginning, in more ways than one. My Berkeley DB files crapped out, meaning I basically have to start from the beginning. I still have all the old stuff stashed in a directory somewhere. I also got a new position at xwave, I'll be working in the Blue Cross center, finally out of the whole call center "thing". I'm also moving into a newer, nicer appartment closer to downtown (3 minutes walk to work).
