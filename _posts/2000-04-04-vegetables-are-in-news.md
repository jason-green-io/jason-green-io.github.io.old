Vegetables are in the news again. I don't want to get into it, too, odd. I'm watching a very intresting Star Trek episode. It's the one where Beverley Crusher is the only person who notices everyone is disappearing. Very cool, well, cool for me. Hihihi. Wow, that lady can act, I never knew. I mean Gates Mcfadden.. Beverly Crusher.. right. Jean-Luc Picard dissapeared!! haha.. ok.. back to reality. Woohoo!! The Traveller.. sorry.. sorry.. back to reality. SO I have to go to work now right.. and I was writing this entry .. oh shit.. I have to go to work now.
