I know, I know, it's kinda cheating, commenting on past entries. But some people probally have never read those .. and it's fun commenting on old stuff. Entertainment for me .. right. I think it was a good idea. I've got another 5 lined up comming after the next 15 entries. After those 5, that's it. I just though of something.. what happens if I decide to do this again.. try to beat my record.. blah... I don't want to beat me record again. doing it once is enough. I think. .. oh well.. I'll deal with that if I ever decide to do it again.
