I just noticed something.. I'm watching Forrest Gump.. when Lieutenant Dan meets Forrest after the show with John Lennon, they're "walking" in the street and a song is playing, Everybody's Talking, it's the main song in Midnight Cowboy, well, when they cross the street, a cab nearly hits them and Lieutenant Dan hit the cab, same thing Deniro does in Midnight Cowboy.. I noticed, I'm so proud.. so obscure.. it's in IMDB.. but they don't say anything about the song.. yay.. woohoo!
