Went out with Ned, his friends and Gary last night. Good times was had by all. Sunsun's afterwards at my place .. sooo good. Listening to Mother and Child Reunion by Paul Simon.

I've been reloading the [Proteus][1] website for the past 4 days now, there's a new version coming out, can't wait to try it. It's a multi-IM client for OS X. The developer has had problems getting v.4 out, bugs and website problems.... cmon Justin, we're dying here.

Many's the time I've been mistaken
And many times confused
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken
And certainly misused
Oh, but I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm just weary to my bones
