I just got back from the Farmer's Market with my co-worker Mark.. I got me a quesdeilla and some spicy beef jerky .. and a french vanilla cap.. because I'm very tired.

Monday, Ned and Moe came over, we watched the elections and a rubber band ball get dropped out of a plane, then we went to Doc's. Tuesday I went over at Joe's place with Al for video games, I just watched, then fell asleep on the floor. Wednesday, I know I went to Nav then Sport's Rock at some point with Ned and Monique.. but I don't remember how I got there. Thursday; Ned, Moe and I met up at Al's place for drinks and a bit of video games. Friday was martinis at brother Marc's place, we watched An Evening With Kevin Smith on TMN (it was TMN 5).

It took me 45 minutes to piece together the last 5 days.. my memory is getting suckier and suckier.

I went to the farmer's market about 1 hour ago and I bought some spicy beef jerky.. mm.. spicy beef jerky. Where'd this french vanilla come from?
