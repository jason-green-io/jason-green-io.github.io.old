I just saw the video for Dancing Queen from ABBA Teens, I love it. I'm very close to solving a Rubik's cube by myself (no help from a guide). Practice makes perfect. I'm gonna go make myself styrosoup now. Done, yummy. Wow, Judith by a Perfect Circle has a really good video. First time I see it all on TV. It's alive, alive! The noodles in the cup are rising, slowly. mmm... This page is slipping, I noticed I'm not updating as often as I was in April.. oh well :)

I just saw the coolest commercial, I have to go buy Jolt Cola. HAHA!! there it is again.. twice in less than a minute!
