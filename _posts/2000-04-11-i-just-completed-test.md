I just completed a test I didn't study for, from the looks of it, seems I passed. I'm updating thru Geocities right now.. and I'm using a different browser, Netscape 6, it's not bad at all. Still has a few bugs in it. It's only Preview Release 1 so it'll only get better. I like the new animation in the top right corner, very cool. I'm drinking Pepsi, not supposed to because of my little heart condition.. but who cares, it's only my heart :)
