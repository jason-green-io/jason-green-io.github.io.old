Al got his PowerBook G4, and I'm not as wireless as before, but that will change soon enough. "That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball." What could I eat.. oh! everyone, thank you everyone for your picture submissions to the main page (that means you Monique, stand up and bow). I'm hungry.. that reminds me of the SubWay commercial. Who knows what I'm talking about?
