I said I'd take a picture of a spectacular sunrise, so I took a picture of a spectacular sunrise. That was this morning.

Coming out of the elevator I saw Anise, I've been saying hi to her since grade 5. I remember bugging the hell out her at Abbey-Landry, I'd say hi, then she'd say hi back, then I'd say hi again .. and on and on. Those were the days.
