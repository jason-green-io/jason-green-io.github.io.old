I'm hungry, it's early, I need caffeine and food. There's an idea.. Tim's should make caffeinated sandwiches. People could eat and stay alert days at a time.





I'm back on vacation starting April 17th. I had alot of unused vacation that I had to use before May.





The third animatrix is up, called Detective Story, it tells the story of a detective hired to track down Trinity. Carrie-Ann Moss actually does the voice, very cool.





This ends my update.
