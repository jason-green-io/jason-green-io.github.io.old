I haven't seen the commercial, but I really want to. It's not on the web as of the time of this posting.

Went out last night, doing the same tonight me thinks.

Hi Caroline Leprince, sorry I put hanger pieces under your door.

I've been watching alot of Family Guy and American Dad lately, damn those are funny shows.

I finished reading The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene, what a great book, blew me away. I'm gonna go wash my self and my clothes now.

Holy crap, I almost forgot, I saw Mama Mia a few weeks ago in Ottawa. It was my first musical .. damn it was cool. The story, the music the set .. everything was amazing. Everyone was dancing in their chairs. Check it out if you ever have the chance. (Mama Mia is a play based on the songs from ABBA, the second best band in the world.)
