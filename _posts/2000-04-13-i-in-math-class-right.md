I'm in math class right now. Again, will be transfering this to digital format in an hour or so. Get Real was pretty good last night. I would have liked to see the other episodes instead of the season finale first. Got Pepsi again, it's a ritual now. Coincidence? Some guy (Derrick) is singing the theme song to Degrassi Junior High. Second time I hear it in 3 days, after it's absence of my auditory system for more than 4 years. Weird stuff is going on this week. Just met Mike, the pilot. He's trying to get scheduled to fly in the twin engine, but no such luck. I offered to pay my way sometime to get a ride with him. I love flying, I don't do it enough. I think I'm going to buy a helicopter. My mother is supposed to get her big check today, I wonder if she can lend me 3*10^3 $. iMac... Time for a sip of my Pepsi. If I was in a band I would like it to be called The Indefinite Integrals. This pen kicks ass. My father has crappy hand wirtting, I noticed something about mine, it's crappy too. I brought my walkman to college today, and all my mix tapes -1, Warmnfuzzy Beatles. I'm not sure I'm going to even have a chance to use it. I only want to use it when I'm alone, because I find people listening to walkmans in public to be a bit anti-social on their part. I dunno. Kinda like crossing your arms when talking to someone. Hi Jeff if you're reading this. This is begining to be a bit long. I never write for this length of time. It's wierd. I'm on my second page, this is amazing! Well.. amazing for.. me, maybe not for you. I'm stopping now.
