Yup, I'm still alive. I said I'd enjoy my weekend, and I did. Spur the moment I decided to go up to Freddy and Woodstock to hang out with "Flur" and Ned. I got to meet Kabuki and see Kill Bill vol. 2 again. As usual, Woodstock was chock full of shock and awe entertainment.

Watched the hockey games tonight, too bad Habs lost .. but Go Flames Go!

Started a 2 week run of night shifts. 00:00 - 08:30. Not too bad, at least I have my evenings off.

Drunken TP this weekend, contact me for details.

Still no word from the Forces.
