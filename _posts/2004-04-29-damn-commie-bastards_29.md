They want total control of their code, nothing open so that people can go in and fix all the bugs their stupid engineers have written *cough* buffer overrun *cough*. Imagine if they'd open up their code, with all the money they have, they'd be able to make the world a better place, litterally .. AND make a profit. Meh, fuck them, I'm sticking with Apple, my Mac does everything I want it to; 50x better than any Windows machine .. I know alot of people switching too, I'm thinking it's a long term trend, slowly as people notice how much better Mac's are, and people let go of the misconceptions that were planted in their brains by Microsoft in the 80s and 90s, they will see the light.
