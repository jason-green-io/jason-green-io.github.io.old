Prompt does this funny thing with background colors. I had to read the terminfo man page .. why Panic, why did you mke me do that! Any who, if you set the background color of screen's or tmux's status bar to the same background as your terminal's default, the aberations go away.

Also, not sure, but I think the latest update to Prompt fixed issues I was having in vim
