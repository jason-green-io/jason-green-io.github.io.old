Let's take some time here and talk about cat-5 cable .. I've been seeing an interesting trend lately .. alot of stuff it using it. There's an HDTV signal extender that's coming out soon that uses it .. there are USB AND Firewire extenders that use the stuff. The new Airport base stations that Apple makes has always used it BUT! they can now be powered by cat-5 .. that's right, it can also power low power devices .. perfect for wireless access points. I'm thinking you need to dedicate 1 of the pairs to power and may need to hook up the network in power compatible hubs or something.. I dunno, haven't had time to look it up, but I will eventually.
