Holy s*** I'm bored. (This page is rated general, for all audiences) I'm in hour 2 of electronics. Last hour I fell asleep. Wilbur, eh?, right. He always puts me to sleep. I got Pepsi and a Coffee Crisp, that should keep me awake till the afternoon, the time my brain usually wakes up.

"I'd like to share a revelation that I've had, during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague, and we are the cure."

I love that movie. Vin Vout Vin Vout. I'm gonna go mad. I can't wait to get home and.. not be here. Course is done, here I go to type this in. (that last sentence doesn't sound gammatically correct)
