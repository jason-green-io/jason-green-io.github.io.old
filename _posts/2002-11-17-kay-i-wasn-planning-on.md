Kay, I wasn't planning on changing the entire look of the site.. but I got really bored.. and I only have 21 days left in my trial copy of Photoshop so I had to do something. I think it looks pretty cool. I'm sure there'll be refinements.. there's stuff I don't like, but since it's real early, I'll call it quits for now.
