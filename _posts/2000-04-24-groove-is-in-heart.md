Groove is in the Heart is the first song I have learned by myself on a bass. It's what I'm using to practice my speed and agility. I love it! Remi decided to start his own page, [Stuff in my Head][1]. If anyone else start his/her own online journal thing, I will have to severly beat them, it's become way out of hand! Notice the symbols on top, now it's illegal! Ha! Going to bed, I have a car tomorrow!! WOOHOO, I haven't had a car to go to college since, before way winter break.
