Watched Grosse Point Blank with Ned, good flick.. Minnie did a great job hiding her accent. Listening to Smokin' in the Boys Room grace à Corinne.

I discovered Jazz yesterday I think.. Susannah McCorkle's Water's of March.. kick ass.. if anyone out there has got jazz recommendations, please, don't hesitate, let me know what you like..

I did something I wasn't supposed to tonight.. I'm saying that just so that I remember it whenever I look back on it.
