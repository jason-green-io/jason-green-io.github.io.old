I got my credit card back.. and the NBPower situation is resolved, just a case of me not being able to read. All the charges made perfect sense when they were so gracefully explained to me over the phone by a customer service representative. More proof that I am, in fact, a dumbass.

This is a great landmark to use when trying to find my place when driving.. or Moncton from a 767 for that matter.
