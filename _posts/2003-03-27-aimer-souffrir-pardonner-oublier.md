p>Good morning folks, welcome to my neglected blog. Since I can't sleep, I decided I'd spend some time typing in here. Goin' to Woodstock tomorrow to party with Ned, Yves is down for a couple of weeks and he'll also be there.. we're going to party like it's 1998! Can't wait to get back on Saturday though.



How about that war eh?





I shovelled my drive way 2 days ago with some help, my car can now park in front my door. Roz and I hacked away at a huge icy bulge in the middle of the driveway for half an hour.. then we shoveled out a section of a drift.. it's great to park there again.. there's still a fair amount of ice there.. like a mini mount Carleton, but the car can go over it as easily as a penguin can traverse a sand dune. (I invented that last one, does it make sense? I don't think it does, but it's a nice contrast)
