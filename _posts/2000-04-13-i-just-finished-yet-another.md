I just finished yet another test.. this one was the easiest of them all. For those of you who are DOS literate, I will explain to you the WHOLE test. Make a floppy bootable. Create various directory structures. Make a file called "MYFILE.TXT" with a hidden attribute with name inside. That's it. Jeff is next to me reading the page and refreshing while I update.. it's fun too see.
