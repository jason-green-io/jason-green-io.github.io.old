I am soooo not impresed right now... Wonderfalls got cancelled... I'm am to the point of crying right now.. it's so sad.. fucking studio executives... fucking profit .. fucking self interest. That and I just got pretty much kicked out of the Paramount. Very very very bad combination. I'll post more more when I'm sober.

Sorry Lyne.. I read the first line and I knew exactly what it was.. I remember drinking gallons of the stuff. I was busy at Paramount telling Marc Dupuis how I didn't like the fact that he wanted to throw me in the spit pit at Vanier. Next time you have have a question like that, call me, please!
