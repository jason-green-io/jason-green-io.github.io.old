I'm still alive. The computers here suck.

I'm having a great time. My typical day starts with a 20 minute run at 0500, then breakfast, then an inspection at which point I get yelled at because my sock aren't folded correctly.. then I go to class (drill, first aid, military knowledge .. other boring stuff where people fall asleep). The food is okay .. it's free, I can't complain. Next weekend I might be able to get off the base (our whole platoon is currectly confined to base .. totally normal for the first 4 weeks.) I'll hopfully be getting my parents to send me my laptop so I'll be able to get a high speed connection somewhere in town .. for the time being, I'm using loonie pay machines that connect thru dial-up. That's all for now. S'ouaira.
