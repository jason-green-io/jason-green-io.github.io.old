I took an hour, but I finally did something I wanted to do for a a while now. Notice the arrows next to the date, you can browse thru the days now. Yay! And I changed the calendar part a bit too, now it even MORE compact. Oh and I put the same link style as in the calendar part too.. on EVERY PAGE.. whew.. so now link under/overline, like my [page][1]. I may add another little feature before the end of the day, nothing much.. but it'll be cool. For me anyway..
