Ben hallo. I decided to take the rest of my shifts off as vacation, meaning I'm officially done at xwave .. well .. not officially, only after my vacation, June 11th.

Went to Cosmo, listened to Norm for a while then went dancing with Danielle and Christine. Then went to Smart Pizza and listened to some guy called Jeremie play guitar .. right there, at Smart Pizza.. pretty cool stuff. Then I got home and watched Shrek 2, wow, what a funny movie, my favorite part is near the end "I'm a rea ... d'ahhhhhhhhh" .. poor Pinocchio.

I got my "The Cheat" t-shirt .. The Cheat rock rocks on!
