Those Mr. Noodles sure were good, and the Pringles I had this afternoon were good too! Time for more orange juice. I like orange juice, it matches this page :).

"I bet we've been together for a million years, and I'll bet we'll be together for a million more. Oh, it's like I started breathing on the night we kissed, and I can't remember what I ever did before. What would we do baby, without us, what would we do baby without us, and there ain't no nothing we can't love eachother thru, what would we do baby, without us, sha la la la."

"There's a time for love and a time for livin. Take a chance and taste the wind. There's an open road and a road that's hidden, a brand new life around the bend. There were times, I lost a dream or two, found a trail, and at the end was you. There's a path you take and a path not taken, the choice is up to you my friend. The night are long but you might awaken, to a brand new life, a brand new life, a brand new life around the bend."
