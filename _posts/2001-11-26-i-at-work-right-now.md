I'm at work right now, fun stuff.. it's busy off and on, right now it's not. I'm reading The Fellowship of the Ring right now, very cool stuff. Fantasy stories usually don't intrest me, but in this case.. I'm intrested in a classic.. and I know why it's so popular, it's good. Almost halfway, trying to get it done before the movie comes out. I'm pretty sure I'll succeed. I bought an [iPod][1], it's real nice. Expensive, but worth every penny.
