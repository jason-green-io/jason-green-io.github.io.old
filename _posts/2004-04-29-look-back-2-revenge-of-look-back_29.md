I'm at Caro's. I just finished fixing her computer, woohoo! Such a good feeling fixing a problem I have no idea how to fix :) I'm supposed to get a reward, I can't wait! Al's gone to the liquor store, I guess we're gonna party it hard Al style. Woohoo!




I never did get that reward. I remember us joking about it being of a sexual nature though :) I haven't partied it hard Al style in a while .. I've partied hard .. but not Al style.
