Ma Brain is changing, in hopes of posting more often, I'm changing the format so that the whole month is on one page, that way I won't have to create extra files and alot of menus and links. It'll suck if you want to read everything previous, but I'll keep the file naming convention easy enough, I may even include some kind of index. I think I'll reformat the whole thing, that would mean incorperating all the old day by day posts into monthly pages, it's alot of work, but my patience with coding versus my will to actually getting stuff out there is coliding in a mediocre clash of non-important things.
