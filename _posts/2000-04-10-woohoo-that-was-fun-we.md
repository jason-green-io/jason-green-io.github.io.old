WOOHOO!! That was fun.. we just had a freak hail/snow storm with 100 Km/h winds. I went for a walk outside. (me being the extreme weather enthusiast) The cloud poop looked like styrofoam, or that foam/putty stuff Nickelodeon used to advertize. I think I'll go to bed read and think now, mostly read, but think a little too. Or maybe I wont think, maybe I'll just read.. well.. I'll have to think to read, but I mean.. .. g'night.
