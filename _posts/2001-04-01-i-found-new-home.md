I've found a new home for ma barin.. it has a bit more ads, but at lease it doesn't have a pop up thing.. That's something I didn't like about yahoo.. pop ups. I worked today, fun fun. I'm getting a cold, my nose is sniffling. I'm enjoying my laptop very much right now, I'm sitting in my favorite chair and I'm just typing away comfortably. Love it.
