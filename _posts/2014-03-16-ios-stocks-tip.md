Did you know you can use the built-in Stocks app to view the current and historic exchange rate for currencies? Yup, try it, enter `GBPCAD=X` as a quote. Replace what you're exchanging before the `=X`.

Quotes sync with iCloud and they show up in the today swipe down view if configured in Settings. Convenient.
