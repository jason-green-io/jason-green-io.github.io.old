I'm cancelling blogger pro! I'm using movable type, and it's the bestest thing ever. This is my first official post with it.. as you can see, I've had alot of test posts. Just to let you know what's new.. I can now add titles to my entries.. yay, no big deal. Comments, you can tell me how stupid I am.. or mock my spelling and point out my typos. That's about it. New to me is reliability, more flexible templates, kick ass user interface and much much more. One more thing.. if you see "do you want to know more?" it means the post is extended, meaning there's more if you click the link. If you have any suggestions, find anything broken, leave a comment or drop me an email.
