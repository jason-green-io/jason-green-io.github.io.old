That was fun.. I just spent the last 45 minutes updating myself with [Nic][1]'s blog. If not all of you heard the news, Lynie has discontinued her blog.. it's a sad day for blogging. You wouldn't be reading this if it wasn't for her. Please join me in a moment of silence.





(moment of silence)





That is the cycle that is life, one less blog to read, one more blog to read. From death comes life.





Played cards with the usual gang Saturday-Sunday, Leo, Joe, Joker and I. I love playing cards.. I've always wanted to have a card night.. every week.. something to look forward to. Our schedules never allow it happen that often, that's why Saturday-Sunday was great (Saturday-Sunday means midnight Sunday, I can't really say Saturday, even though most people associate that time of day to Saturday.. technically it's really Sunday. Work overnight and you'll understand what I'm trying to explain.)





I need to watch a movie.. it's called [Two Hands][2], but I can't find it anywhere. I can buy it as a region 2 DVD at amazon.de.. but I'd like to watch it before buying it.





I miss my Palm m515, I have a few dates I need to remember and I'm forced to use paper to keep track of them, yuk.





[Supa Greeeeg, Numba 1!][3] There's a story behind that flash animation and it's quite suprising.. very very smart of Lee Jeans.. I won't put it here, I'll let you investigate.
