It's really early, I'm in bed listening to ABBA. I did nothing tonight, except watch the latest Enterprise episode and Conan. Speaking of TV shows.. I started watching The O.C.; I'm totally addicted to that show. There's something about it's soap opera'ish qualities that just sucked me in. Fucking Oliver Trast, I despise him!

I bought Glade plug-ins refils, they smell really nice, my bedroom door is open and I can barely smell it.. very tropical, *snifff* ahhhhhh.

Damn I'm boring.



I climb the walls of my mind just like I'm climbing on a jungle gym
I am more than content with the
state of mind I am in
'cause I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.
I don't think I need a rubber room,
but hey, that might be nice
I'm not a manic depressive paranoid or schizophrenic so I don't need your advice.
I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.
The lights are on but nobody's home
my elevator doesn't go to the top
I'm not playing with a full deck
I've lost my marbles
The lights are on but nobody's home
my elevator doesn't go to the top
I'm not playing with a full deck
I've lost my marbles.
I'm a few bricks short of a load,
but a full load always hurt my back.
I flew over the cuckoo's nest and
I'm never ever coming back because
I am crazy just like you
I am crazy just like you.
I am crazy.
