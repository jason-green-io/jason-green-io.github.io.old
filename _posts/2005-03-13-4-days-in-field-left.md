Last week I was in Farnham .. shot my C7, slept in a tent, used Coleman stoves and lanterns, reminded me alot of camping when I was in Scouts. I've got 4 more days of that .. then I graduate in 1.5 weeks. Excitement is mounting! I'm still not sure if I'll be able to go home for Easter.. I have to wait until I present myself to my next unit and ask there. On ouaira. I'm pissed that I still haven't seen the ROTS full trailer yet.. dammit.
