This is worth an entry. I'm listening to Big Sugar, why, because I listen to Big Sugar when things are going well. I only like Big Sugar when I attain this level. Why are things suddely going so well? Remember me complaining about MITI, about how I couldn't get a job there, how people were getting called, and not I. Well.. My interview is at 15:00 today. That's right Al, I got an interview!
