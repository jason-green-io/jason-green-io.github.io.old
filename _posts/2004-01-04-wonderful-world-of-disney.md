Wow, that's still on on CBC. I remember watching it every Sunday night when I was young. Lion King is the feature tonight. I haven't seen that in a while. "They call meeee, MISTER PIG!!"

New Years was great! Oxygen with Monique, Ned and Ryan. I met someone I hadn't spoken to in 6 years. Looks like we might be speaking more in the near future ;)
