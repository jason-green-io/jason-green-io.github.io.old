Kevin O'Brien is credited as being the first person to call me "greener". Kevin was my neighbor when I moved to Dieppe in 91'. He was a huge hockey fan, and apparently there was a hockey announcer called "greener" .. or something .. so the name stuck, he never reffered to me using my real name. Then I met Nic, I started using "greener" as my handle, using his computer, on BBS' and online. He started calling me "greener" .. then it spread to Scouts .. then my parents .. then the world. Today, not everyone calls me "greener", mostly an even distribution of "Green" and "Jay". But here and there I'll get a "hey greener!" or a "greener!".
