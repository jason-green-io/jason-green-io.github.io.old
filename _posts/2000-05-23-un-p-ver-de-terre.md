"C'était un p'tit ver-de-terre qui traverse le trotoire, je le prend, je le ramansse, yuk, c'est dont ben déguelasse"


That's Album du Peuple - Tome 3. I love it! Al C. dropped by. Was cool. My Palm won't turn on. Pisses me off. I don't know what I'm going to do. Maybe bring it back to Future Shop, they may do something. I'm out of Styrosoup, I'll need to get my mom to buy more. Yum. I didn't get paid today. My bass is ready, but I need cash. Damn holiday.. wait.. what am I saying.
