I bought some styro soup... and it's soooo gooood.. I hadn't had any in a long time.. if you you don't know what I'm talking about, search for it here, at the bottom (or top) of the page. Listening to Hello City. I saw How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days last night with Isabelle and Ad√®le, loved the movie, depressing though, but I won't go into details here. :) Need a glass of water.





I'm gonna go complete my Rubik's Cube now.
