I don't know if they actually say that or not, but we're going to find out. We're moving to England for 3 years.

We'll be in NB 3 - 6 May, moving sometime in late July. We'll be having a number of going away parties to get some use of our deck. For those who haven't visited us in Ottawa yet .. now would be a good time :)
