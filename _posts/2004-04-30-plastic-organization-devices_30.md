PODs I like to call them .. no, I don't really call them that, I didn't even make up the acronym, just so happens it fits .. "POD". Yeah, I've got alot of my stuff in these container things .. memories from MM, pictures, souvenirs comic books and camping equipment. They rock, I remember a time when I didn't have them, I had drawers filled to the brim with crap, I couldn't find anything .. now I've got plastic thingies that are filled to the brim, but transparent, and I still can't find anything. I need to buy more, I've got more crap that needs to be "organized".
