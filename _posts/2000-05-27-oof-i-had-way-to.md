Oof. I had way to much fun tonight, not that that's a bad thing. I went to Cosmo with Nathalie and her friend Lynn. I met Roger and we went do Doc's looking for Caro, didn't find her, very dissapointing. TH reason for going was people from work were there, including Jenn and Jenn.. I danced with Jenn. Wayne gave me a free beer at Doc's. I think I have an entry on the [27th][1] that I just put.. yeah.. I have the hicups, real bad.
