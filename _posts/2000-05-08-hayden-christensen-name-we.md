Hayden Christensen, a name we will all be hearing of alot soon. He's the one who going to play the guy we'll see change into Darth Vader. I need to buy 4 AAA rechargeable batteries and a AAA rechargeable battery charger. Gonna do that tomorrow, it's for my [Palm IIIe][1]. I think I have allergies, something I've never had before. Just recently my sinuses have been clogging up, and I've been sneezing more. Intresting.

"Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms just say the word, and they are yours
Just help yourself to the love,
In my heart your smile has opened up the door
The greatest wealth that exists in the world,
Could never buy what I can give
Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms, and then lets really start to live
Allllllllll right. Yeah"
