What a fun time working. Not! Nice weather to own Gore-Tex in. I love wind and rain. Actually, I like extreme weather in general. I need something to drink, I'm dehydrated. I think I'll go get a nice tall glass of milk. I'm listening to Barenaked Ladies at this moment, I downloaded all of Gordon from Nick, their best album in my opinion. Sounds like I need to get off of my ass and do something. My friend the were-motherf*** is hungry, poor him. Right. It's time for!..

Fractals are used especially in computer modeling of irregular patterns and structures in nature.
