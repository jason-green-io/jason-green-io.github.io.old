Soo ya, Paramount, I didn't really get kicked out. It was closing time, and the bartender had a few friends over, I imagine they were going to have some kind of shindig there, and I wasn't invited. Me being drunk out of my mind at the time wanted to keep having fun, so I was persistent, they had to talk me into leaving, and a girl pretty much escorted me out the door to make sure I was out of there.

Back to work today, 2 more print nights and I have the weekend off. Ned is in Moncton on the weekend, probally gonna go out drinking with him on Friday with his buddies .. Lyne and I still have a TP game we need to finish. Monique called from Calagary, she gets free food at the hotel, how cool is that. I wore my kilt in public for the fist time yesterday, I wore it to Jean's Restaurant and walked back, it was snowing, and I was getting interesting looks from people. S'all good, that's part of the point, felt soo good walking in the cool air, free :) Thank you [Patrick Norton][1] for showing me the light.

I'm almost done reading [Demon Haunted World][2].. next up will be some [David Suzuki][3] then more of Carl .. did I say that already?

I maintain there is much more wonder in science than in pseudoscience. And in addition, to whatever measure this term has any meaning, science has the additional virtue, and it is not an inconsiderable one, of being true.

Carl Sagan




I've got another of his quotes [here][4], it's a great burn!
