Another lack of updates. No, I'm not skipping work .. I wish I could .. soon I won't have to. I booked the vacation I've accumulated during the year and will use it prior to June 11, which brings my last day to May 28.

Aliant is on strike .. doesn't affect me one bit. Yay for them.

I start 2 weeks of nights on Tuesday at midnight. I'm going to enjoy my weekend. I applied for the Air Force thru the website, now I'm waiting for a call from the recruiters. I can't wait to get the ball rolling on this.
