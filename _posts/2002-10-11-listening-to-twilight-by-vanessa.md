Listening to Twilight by Vanessa Carlton, a very talented lady. You can feel the emotion in her music, it's not just a replica of what pop tries to do, this sounds like the real deal. Think Sarah Maclachlan and Jewel. So I'm alone at home with no chat buddy. Buddy is gone. I'm sad that buddy is gone, for more reasons than one. The music isn't helping.
