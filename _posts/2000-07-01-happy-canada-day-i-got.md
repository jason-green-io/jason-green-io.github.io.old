Happy Canada day!

I got a new bed, about 2 days ago, it's huge compared to the one I had. It has a matching armoir thing.. or whatever. My bass playing is getting better. Thought I'd give you an update on that. Right now I'm going into Napster to get New Orleans is Sinking, a song I heard last night that I said I could learn on bass. Wow.. it's really easy.
