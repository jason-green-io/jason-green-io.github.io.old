I don't eat enough cereal.. in fact, I don't breakfast period. I should start .. eating cereal that is. I used to love Captain Crunch. That would have to be my all time fav, but I also liked Chex, Corn Pops, Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Lucky Charms. Then I'd be forced to buy more milk, which I like but don't drink enough of. Have they solved the soggyness problems? I remember Chex being really good at preserving it's crunch factor after a long duration exposed to milk. I'm thinking I'm going buy some Chex.
