There's a new trailer out for Matrix Revolutions, as usual, it's very cool. I can't convey into words how much I am anticipating this movie. I've been craving this sequel since I walked out of the theatre the first time I saw the first one.





Bois Joli, May 3rd, Cocagne (center of the known universe), be there or be trapezoidal.
