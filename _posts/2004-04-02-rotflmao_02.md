Damn that was a good episode! Wonderfalls is now my favorite show. They better not cancel it. I brought my camera at work, there's alot of interesting things to see, I'll see if I can't take nice pictures. One I'd like to try is a picture of the server room with the lights out.. should be cool with all the LEDs and such. I had a chicken pizziola sub and some Bawls for supper. While I was at Subway, there was a gaggle of goths .. or young caffeine addicted adolecents .. or something. One even had a Toshiba laptop and was listening some kind of heavy song. They all went to [Ground Zero Netwroks][1], I followed them there where I bought my [Bawls][2]. I wonder if they have a wireless access point there? If they don't .. I might just donate one of my routers in exchange for free access.. wouldn't that be cool.
