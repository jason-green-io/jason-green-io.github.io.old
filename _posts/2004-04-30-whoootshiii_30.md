Crack that whip
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
Break your momma's back

When a problem comes along
You must whip it
Before the cream sits out too long
You must whip it
When something's going wrong
You must whip it

now whip it
into shape
shape it up
get straight
go forward
move ahead
try to detect it
it's not too late
to whip it
whip it good

When a good time turns around
You must whip it
You will never live it down
Unless you whip it
No one gets their way
Until they whip it

I say whip it
Whip it good
