Yo, sup? I'm back. A few changes though. No more primary visual cortex stimulation of the day, check my main page for that. Since Lynie put a link up, I wouldn't want to bore her visitors, so I'm starting again. I find I have time.. kinda.. and a new computer :) (the iBook if you've been reading). I'm still here, sitting in college, typing away in geocities instead of doing HTML (the course). Actually.. theoretically (I love that word) I *AM* doing HTML, just not the assigned assignments.. . ha! I just got when the word assignments comes from.. they assign.. .. oh you knew that? well.. pffft fine! Remi is down and we're filming a movie, the details are top secret so I can't tell you anything.
