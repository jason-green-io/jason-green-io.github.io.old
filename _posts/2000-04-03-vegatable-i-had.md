"You're a vegatable" I had no idea THAT was in a Micheal Jackson song. That's what I'm listening to now, an old song called Wanna be Starting Something off of Thriller. I remember listening to that album days on end in the mid eighties. Specially this song.. a specific memory I have is when we had our old trailer, we were camping near a beach, and I had these Micheal Jackson books, everytime I'd see them I'd start singing in my head "Mama se mama sa mamamacousa" (it's at the end of the song). Brings back memories. I used to be a Micheal Jackson fan. Ahhh.. finally got it off my chest :) I ate more for supper, like I said I would. Hamburg, potatoes, corn and gravy.. mmmm. .. I like using "double dots" and "quotations" (and sometimes even partheses). And now for something completely different. [Pi][1]
