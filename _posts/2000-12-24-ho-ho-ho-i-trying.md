HO HO HO.. I'm trying to decide whether I should start speaking in here again, I got an email from someone who liked the page.. a total stranger. For now this will stay hidden.. if you've found this.. well good for you.. it'll go up if I start it again.
Here's the email.

Hi "greener"

I was surfing geocities and checked out your site at
geocities/greener. I have a good friend with a really similar
site, and I passed your url along to her. Have you ever seen a
weblog? I was noticing your writing style, and I think the weblog
format might really work well for you. I just started one
recently, and I am actually thinking of dumping my homepage in
favor of just having the weblog, since I'm enjoying it so much
more than maintaining my homesite. Anyway, I really just wanted
to say thanks for an interesting site!

Come visit!


Bianca
