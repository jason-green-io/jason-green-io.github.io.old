4 more weeks to graduation

We recieved our C-7 rifles .. what fun! Parents are coming down for the weekend, staying at the Queen Elizabeth in Montreal .. if I get the weekend off.
My laptop is here.. but it died, again, so I'm going to try and get it fixed during the weekend.. then I'll be back online whenever I want.
That is all for now.
