I got the charger. I'm bored. DOn't read this, you'll only get bored too. If you are bored, you'll get even more bored. At one point you'll say to yourself "there's no way I can get anymore bored than I am now", then you'll read this, and in an instant, you'll realise there's a whole other realm of bordom beneath the one you were in. Not only is there bordome below, but there' boredome on the sides too, it's called "side boredome". I'm bored. [Lazy Labs][1], good site.
