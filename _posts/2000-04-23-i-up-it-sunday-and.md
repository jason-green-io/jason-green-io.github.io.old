I'm up, it's Sunday, and almost 10. Feels real good. Watched 28 Days with Caro last night, movie wasn't too bad, but not that great either. Later on I watched Star Trek: First Contact, what an awesome movie! Well, for a non-fan, I can imagine you're thinking... pfft, ya Star Trek.. well.. for a Star Trek movie.. it's very very good! I think I just hacked up a cat.. yuk.

This is one of my favorite comic strips, it's sometimes hilarious. Most of the time it's, intresting.
