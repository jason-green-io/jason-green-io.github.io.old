Starting next Friday I'll be on the graveyard shift. My shift will be 2230 to 0900. Can't wait to see if I can adjust. I pretty sure I can, I'm a very adaptive human being. The forest fire smell has dissipated, I didn't smell anything when I arrived from work last night. I kinda liked the smell, reminded me of camp fires and the great outdoors.





For all you Mac OS X users out there, don't forget to download Safari, Apple's new browser. It features built in spell check.. a life saver for me and the last post I made.
