Hello fellow humans. I have returned from the place called work. I saw a couple people I know tonight: Joker, Vero, Eric, Wayne, Camco Al, and many other I don't know personally. It's fun doing cash. My dad taped WWTBAM, that rocks! I got till Sunday off, that rocks! Yves is comming down Saturday, that rocks! We have a staff showing of Center Stage, that rocks! They're announcing great weather in the near future, that rocks! Alot of things rock! You have got to see this site [Science Made Stupid][1], its sooooo funny and it rocks!
