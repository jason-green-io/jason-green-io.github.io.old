What an action packed night. Went to the mall today, I think I want to buy a digital camera, and a DVD player.. and I want to own property on the moon. It's Un-cover on Much.. kick ass.. they play songs covered by other artists. Very cool. The world is being invaded by Mouseketters. Britney Spears, 2 guys in n'Sync, Kerri Russell. We need to increase our defences. Planet Britney is on!! Woohoo!! Sorry.
