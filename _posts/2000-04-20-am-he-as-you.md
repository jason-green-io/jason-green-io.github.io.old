"I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together."

I'm guarding Louis' CDRW, pretty cool thing, he's got the IDE cable sticking out of the case of a normal college computer lab computer. He's got direct CD installed. He got a RW disk in there. He got power connecter splitter.

"He got joo-joo eyeball he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please"

It's quote The Beatles day! Finally, a nice break from college. I'm working tomorrow all day till 10, off Saturday, off Sunday and Monday 6-10 or something.. yes.. days off.. and nights I can stay up without any problems. oh.. and that means sleep too.

[Lou's got a site now too][2]. But he's wrong about one thing, I wasn't first, Lyne was.
