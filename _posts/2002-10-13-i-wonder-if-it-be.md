I wonder if it'd be worth it if I subscribe to Blogger Pro. I'd have a bunch of extra features.. like posting in the future, and the past. .. Future might not be as useful as past.. I'd be able to put all my old posts into blogger. It also allows me to post to my blog via email, dunno if I'd use it, but it's interesting.
