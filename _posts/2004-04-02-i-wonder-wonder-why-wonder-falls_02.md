First image is of the IDC room at work, _Internet Data Center_. It's 4 of many cabinets, lots of interesting stuff in those, specially the last one on the right. Second image is my desk I share with my fellow co-workers. In the background are the shattered remains of what was once a busy service management center.

We're bobbing along in our barrel
Some of us tip right over the edge
But there's one thing really mystifying
It's got me laughing, and it's got me crying
All my life it would be death-defying
Until I know
I wonder, wonder why the wonder falls
I wonder why the wonder falls on me
I wonder, wonder why the wonder falls
With everything I touch and hear and see
