I`m not home. nor did I sleep at home this morning. I`m at Michelle's. She's not here at the moment, she went to the market. I slept in double bed, something I haven`t done in years. Michelle,s parents have a kick ass recoed library, you know, the big black things that use needles that you see in museums. Anyway. I had very much, alot of, fun last night/this morning. Just thought I`d let the world know.
