Sorry about the blurriness .. I was on the wrong setting .. I could set my watch back and take another picture, but that would just be a big fat lie .. kay, maybe not big and fat.. but it'd be a lie. Reminds me of December 12th 1992 at 12:12:12 at Al's in Memramcook. I think I've got that piece of paper somewhere.
