I don't often do product reviews (ever? I this the first?). This product is so good and I'm so happy with it that I have the need to share.

I needed a case for my phone that could also replace my wallet. I didn't want the front to get scratched like my last iPhone. I ended up getting a [DODOcase durables sleeve][1]. That case is now on sale on eBay. The pockets on it weren't adequate as a wallet replacement. Cards kept falling out. Then I found the [Pad & Quill Little Pocket Book][2]. I love it. If you're looking to consolidate your wallet and iPhone, go buy one now. They're very well made and smell nice. (Yes, I said smell)
