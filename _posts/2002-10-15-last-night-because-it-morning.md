Last night (because it's morning now) Al R., Leo and I drove up to FP and watched The Transporter.. Lynie, you didn't miss anything. It sucked. Al wanted to see it because of the action sequences.. and I'll give him that, there were a few original, good action scenes, but the rest of the movie was just plain old bad. When we got back we played Trivial Pirsuit.. twas fun, Leo won, though we never finished the game, then Joker joined us and we played a real game.. 200. We played three rounds and Leo and I won 2. Making us the 200 champions, w00t w00t.

Leo went home at 2 and both Als and I went over to Joker's place and played Halo.. well, Joker and I played Halo, Al just fell asleep on the couch. We had a little multiplay action going on with jeeps blowing up and stuff, then we played the final level on Legendary, fun stuff. All in all it was a fun night.

Hey Pretty Baby With The
High Heels On
You Give Me Fever
Like I've Never, Ever Known
You're Just A Product Of
Loveliness
I Like The Groove Of
Your Walk,
Your Talk, Your Dress
I Feel Your Fever
From Miles Around
I'll Pick You Up In My Car
And We'll Paint The Town
Just Kiss Me Baby
And Tell Me Twice
That You're The One For Me
