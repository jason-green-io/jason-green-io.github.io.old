I wonder if I can still pull off that 86 .. I'd have to post 50some entries today .. I think it's possible. I promise not to cheat, like posting one word entries, I'll try and make them as interesting as *I* possibly can. It's going to be tough, I'm going to have to start a list of things to talk about, a list of 54 subjects.. and talk about them. Wow, what could a list like that look like?
