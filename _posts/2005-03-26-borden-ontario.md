So I graduated, that was a fun day. Parents came up for that. Now I'm in Borden Ontario waiting for my course to start. It's like purgatory.. a big void. I have no idea when my course starts meaning I have no idea how long I'll be here. Borden itself is barren, Barrie is close by, a small metropolis. Barrie isn't walking distance, so I bought a car. 2005 Echo hatchback .. it's blue.

That's the news.. what's new with you?
