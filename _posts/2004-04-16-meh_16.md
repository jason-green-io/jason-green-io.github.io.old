Quite a slacker aren't I? I skipped another day! I meant to post last night, but I fell asleep during Survivor and only woke up at the end of The Apprentice, then I went to bed.

Nothing much new .. finally I got to watch a new Smallville episode. Hoping to see [Kill Bill vol. 2][1] tonight. I bought [Kill Bill vol. 1][2], [Lost in Translation][3], [Two Towers][4] and [The Matrix: Revolutions][5]. I was hesitant in buying Kill Bill vol. 1 knowing they're going to release a special edition. Meh.

Proteus is out .. not that great. Still needs time to cook.
