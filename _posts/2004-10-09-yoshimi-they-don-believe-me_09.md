It's a relaxed Saturday afternoon here in Irishtown. I'm thinking I'll be seeing Team America tonight.. then head to the Player's Lounge and see Doyle work his magic. Freddy Al is supposed to come down for that, I'm hoping I'll see him there.. wasn't able to coordinate with him cuz he hasn't been online all day. I'm eagerly waiting for Enterprise episode 1 season 4 to finish. Last season finished with a twisted cliffhanger.

Here are pictures of my new room:
