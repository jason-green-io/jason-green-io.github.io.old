'm up, I'm up .. which means I have to feverously continue posting here .. and I want to make it quick because it's a beautiful day out. I need to go to Doc's and see if the door is open. I'm wearing shorts like I said I would, Isabelle, Angele and Leo are coming over for supper, Joker is having some kind of ritualistic couples thing .. I dunno. I'm invited for supper, dunno if I want to stick around and see them sacrifice small forest animals.

Nic: I wasn't done posting, that's why I'm not up to 53, I think I mentioned that in an entry.
