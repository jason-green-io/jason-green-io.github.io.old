Well, I skipped my first day. Some people are actually dissapointed. Hm. Very busy at CPC today/night. I sold a personal record number of tickets. With the price changes I was only 2 dollars off. Not bat at all. I still don't have Wayne's CD. I said I'd bring it to him Monday, what am I to do, I think I'll just assassinate Chris. I'm craving soup in a styrofoam cup. Mmmmm. Styro-soup. Yves came, and left, was great seeing him again. I got a cool AOL 5.0 coaster I'm going to use to put my styro-soup on. I can't find a picture of styro-soup.

I love lightning. It's so.. powerful, yet insignificant compared to the power of the Dark Side.
