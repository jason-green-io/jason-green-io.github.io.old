See how I said I'd have a car tomorrow, that was false, since this is the same day, I'll have the car today.. but then, just me explaining the fact that I was wrong just made me sa y something else that is innacurate. I Won't HAVE the car, I HAVE the car, present, it's in the parking lot. Right.. that's a picture of me. I took it today during Computer Repair. I'm ckra-sching my head!
