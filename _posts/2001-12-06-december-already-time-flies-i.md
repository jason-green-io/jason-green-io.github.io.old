December already. Time flies. I helped Joe install Mac OS X today, I am the master of Mac OS X.. ok well, maybe not THE master.. maybe a Jedi, I'm very knowledgable in the ways of Mac OS X (pronounced "Mac oh ess ten", don't get me started on that). I'm working in 5 hours.. I slept 16 hours yesterday, we'll see how today goes. I'll try making a "same day" update, something I haven't done in a while; it'll be to inform you of how the day went having the freaky sleeping habbit and all.
