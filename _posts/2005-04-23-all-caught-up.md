I've been downloading TV shows pretty much 24/7 since I've been in Kingston; trying to catch up to all the time I missed while in basic. I'm happy to report I'm finally all caught up. Here's the list of shows:



  * Smallville
  * Lost
  * Enterprise
  * Amazing Race 6
  * South Park
  * The O.C.
  * Scrubs
  * Grey Matter

I think I'll be going downtown tonight, catch a movie, get some grub then drop by the [Tir Nan Og][1] in no particular order.
