Wow, I was looking thru message boards at work and someone posted this link [Archive.org][1]. Bascally, you type in an address, and you can see what that page looked like in the past. [this][2] is what my page looked like 6 years ago. I think I'm going to modify my exsisting page so some of those elements come back, I find it was very nice.
