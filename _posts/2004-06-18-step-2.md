So I talked to my friendly neighborhood recruiter, and he says I'm set to do all the testing stuff on Wednesday .. that means physical fitness test, aptitude test, medical examination and interview. If I complete all 4 successfully, that means I'll be offered a position with the Canadian Forces. So that's the news .. what's new with you?
