Horray for the holidays. I received a large amount of Future Shop gift certificates. I'll most likely be buying a digital camera, very soon. I'm at work, brought my laptop in case it was REALLY dead, but it's not.. so I'm not doing much with it. Can't wait for the snow to come, I hope we get alot more than they're forecasting.
