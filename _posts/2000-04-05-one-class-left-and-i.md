One class left and I'm outta here. Leo is commin' home with me, actually he's my drive, and we're gonna watch Star Wars Episode IV (4). I like refering to the original trilogy as episodes.. fits in better with the new one, and soon (4-5 years) new oneS. Some poor soul in here got his webpage changed by his friends because they found out his password. That'll never happen to me.. I always pick original passwords, right Ned, Al, Monique? whatever. "Have you ever stared at it, marvelled at it's beauty, it's genius?" I love that movie.

Don't worry about my counter.. the number isn't even close to being accurate. 90 percent of those hits are me. I like to read what I write.. it entertains me.
