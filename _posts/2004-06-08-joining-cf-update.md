I gave my application to a recruiting officer Monday, I was missing a few things, so I had to fill out a few more forms and get transcripts for my college marks. If all ends are tied (missing stuff faxed to Fredericton) by Friday, there's a good chance I'd start my testing and medical stuff the 23-24. Once that's done, I wait for a conditional offer.

Other than that, I've been doing some hockey watching, lots of drinking, some frisbee playing, movie watching, got a wisdom tooth pulled, eye exam .. that's pretty much covers it.
