[She][1] rocks.. her site/email/"whatever else SDF has to offer" is also hosted by .. SDF. Damn I mentioned it twice.





I have nothing else to talk about, so I'll explain why my site was down.. SDF (Super Dimensional Fortress, from Macross) is a "public access unix system" .. meaning, it's a computer anyone can log into, create an account and host a site. SDF is actually 6 or 7 computers, all doing something different, they run NetBSD or something.. so these computers are in Seattle, in some room called a co-location. This room provides them with power, HVAC (Heating, ventilation, air conditioning) and power backup in case something happens. Well, the old provider.. the old co-location, kicked SDF out because allegedly SDF was being attacked by a DDoS (Distributed Denile of Service, basically, a "cyber attack"). So to protect their customers, they kick out SDF and breach the contract. Leaving 20000 people without email, web and other stuff for 3 days. The admin, my hero and idol, found a new co-location to house us. Costs more, but at least it's up and running. There are other details.. but I'll leave them out because they're pretty boring.. you can click [here][2] to know a bit more..





And now for something completely different.
