out. went home. oh, here's an idea, i an use my re light emmitting diode to light up my wycwhile i type in the dark. let me try it...awsome it works.. very well actually. now i'm not forced to use the power consuming backlight. if i take the bus tomorrow, i hope i have the car, i'll surely write something. i can wait to go camping with this. i'll be able to take logs and notes and stuff.. awesome. i must go for the windfish awaits, goodnight_

My friend Al is having problems with elevators. I think he pressed the wrong button, or doesn't know how to operate one. Fireball whiskey, I can't wait.


**11:20**

I have come to a conclusion, there are no pictures of Fireball Whiskey on the internet. After an extensive search, I could find no pictures. I guess I have no math class, that's a good thing. An idiot in my class decided he steal a urinal saop thing an put it in class. Now it stinks, so no class.
