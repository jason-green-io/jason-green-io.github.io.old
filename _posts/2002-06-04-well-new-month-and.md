Well, a new month and I don't need to code 3 pages, woohoo, I love this blog thing.. and I heard someone else is taking advantage of it also.. [vectra][1] woohoo. I'm listening to Chris Colepaugh, it's 5:03, it rocks. Went to Doc's with Ned and Al, actually they were already there, I met them there. Drank a few.. more than a few, maybe 5. T'was fun. Talked to Lynie afterwards, thats always fun. I noticed there's alot of posts on the guestbook, keept them comming!! Time to try to fall asleep, later.
