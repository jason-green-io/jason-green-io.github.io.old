do you know what today is? it's star wars episode 1's first birthday! i'm trying something different tonight, i have my mp3's playing, i put the volume up so i can hear them, just something i'm trying. i watched 3 season finales last night (may 18) first was friends then frasier followed by er. they were all awesome. i'm very impressed with my batteries, they're lasting very well. i have a car today, yay. cotton eye joe i an actually add html in here, and when i paste it, it'll already be there. mark the day, i'm starting to grow a goatie, i'm revolting. flowers on the wall i'm going to bed, enough for this morning.
