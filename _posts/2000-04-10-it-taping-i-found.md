It's taping, I found a couple songs and added them last minute, I'm not telling you what they are because you'll think I'm wierd. I am wierd, but wierd is good. I'm still not telling you. The only way you can know what the songs are is if you ride in my car, or find out from someone who has. Actually, you could hack into my computer, go to my desktop, view my playlist, then you'd know, but there's no way you can hack into my computer.. so.. that leaves you with the previous options. Supper, brb.
