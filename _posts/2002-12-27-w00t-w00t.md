I'm in bed trying to fall asleep. I was very tired today because of lack of sleep in the past 4 days. I've finally recovered, but now I can't fall asleep. Not a big problem.. at least I'll get sleep. Ned and Monique were down for the holidays, them, Al and I went to Right Spot to see CCCC, they rocked the house down, very awesome. I danced for the most part of the night. then yesterday Ned and I saw Two Towers, my third time, what can I say, I ove the movie.





"When I go out, well I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who's goes along with you."





Today is the ex-CPC staff party. Woohoo, I'm actually kinda excited! Been looking forward to it.
