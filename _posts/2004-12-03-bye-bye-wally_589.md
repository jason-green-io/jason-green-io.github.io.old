I have just been informed that Wally's Red and White Canteen, the best take out restaurant in Woodstock NB, is closing its red door December 18th. That day will be a sad day in this man's and many others' lives.

I invite everyone to join the guys in Woodstock on December 18th in Woodstock to bid a fond farewell to one of New-Brunswick's premiere food establishments and toast one of its foremost entrepreneurs.
