I spent the afternoon playing on my bass. I think I'm improoooving. Supper should be ready soon, a ham. I am going to eat ham, unprocessed meat, yes.. unprocessed, you know what I typed.. UNPROCESSED.. it's not KAM, it's real ham. I'm going to eat some. With nummy sweet sauce.. nummy. Cough, cough. Now, I will count in binairy.. 0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111. That's 0-15 in binairy. Lets count in hexadecimal.. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F. That's 0-31 in hexadecimal. Now octal 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 20. That's 0-16 in octal. Ok.. enough.
