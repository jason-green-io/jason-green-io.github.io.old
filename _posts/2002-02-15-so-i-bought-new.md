So I bought a new clip for my phone today, and I'm watching my favorite TV show, The Screen Savers. They rock! I'm done switching over to the year 2002, Ma Brain I mean .. (the site). I have no idea what to write, like you haven't read that before.. I just though of a funny line in an IBM commercial .. know which one I'm talking about? "They stole all our servers!" .. and then .. "Uh no, didn't you get my email, we moved everything onto that one." I'm such a little computer nerd. I got a promotion, my title is now Workload Manager.. though I'm not really management. Yay.
