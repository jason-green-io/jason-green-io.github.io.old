I'm finally recuperated. Al actually had to fill me in on details over lunch today, I don't think I was ever that drunk. I was prettyyy prettyyy prettyyy prettyyyy pretty, prettyy pretty drunk.

I really need to do groceries, I've got a list and everything. I said it before, I need to get the car checked .. still haven't done that.

Curb Your Enthusiasm concluded it's 4th season, it actually ended on a high note, I wasn't expecting that.
