Blogging on the road, Ned and I are currently just outside of Levis QC, we're heading into what seems like a thunderstorm, w00t! It's a big one, one bolt every few seconds. The weather on the way up was really nice, when we hit Rivi√®re du Loup it kinda got warm and muggy .. that's probally why there's a thunderstorm .. d'oh, we're not going in it, oh well, I'm sure there'll be more on the way. Montreal is 235 KM away. Oh wait, scratch that, we will be going into one of them, seems there's a alot of them. Woohoo, lots of rain and lightning and stuff!
