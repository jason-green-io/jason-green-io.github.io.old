First picker goes down due to hard drive problems, then there's the latest developments in my soap opera life .. now my iBook is dying due to hard drive problems. I'm not upset or anything .. but it's a little unpleasant.

I'm not worried about picker, people hardly used it. I'm not rushed to fix it, but I do want to fix it. My soap opera .. it's nice to be in one instead of watching for a change. Que sera, sera. I'm brining my iBook in as soon as I'm positive I have all my stuff backed up, or that it dies completely.

That's it, it's official, I'm never using IE again. Unless I need it at work to visit a crappy Microsoft biased site.
