What fun! Tonight, (last night), Lyne, Al and I played Trivial Pursuit. Lyne won, but by a very narrow margin. I sucked most of the game but caught up very quickly near the end. I'm in bed listening to Take Five by Dave Brubeck.. well not anymore, the song just ended, now it's Bran Van 3000. "All I want to do is love you"
