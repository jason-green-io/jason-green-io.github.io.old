I don't want to be here. I'm on break from a class I can't stop falling asleep in. Wilbur. eh? Ya got yer slow speakin' guy in front of the class, right, eh? And e' talks like this there, eh, right? Drives me crazy. I'm going to Cosmo tonight. Gonna party like it's Wednesday, April 5th 2000. I can't wait to get home and try to figure out what the hell is going with the thing with the person and the stuff with the thing. Yeah.. Gibberish, don't ya love it. If it wasn't for chaos, we wouldn't know we exsist. Think about that.
