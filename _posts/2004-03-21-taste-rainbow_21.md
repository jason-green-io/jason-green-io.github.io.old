Look farmiliar?

For those of you who frequent Al @ Freddy's site, you'll know he's in the process of revamping it. He's switching to MovableType .. the best blogging software out there.. it's the best Jerry, the best! (I'll stop beating that Seinfeld line with a dead horse .. and a stick .. ??? .. or whatever.) Everyone needs to start watching Wonderfalls, I've been quoted saying: "It's the best show that's come out of Fox since That 70s Show, in my opinion!" Alot of the cast is Canadian, and it takes place in Canada, though some people are debating that, the store is clearly on this side of Niagra Falls. This is my latest playlist, I call it "wayback":

Ah yes, the 80s, the time of Rubik's cubes, the peak of the Hungry Hungry Hippo craze (comprised of Henry, Harry, Homer and Happy Hippo) and when ABBA started sucking (some will argure that they always sucked, but I disagree, you bastards) More [80s][3] here.

_Thank you Moose for pointing out all the errors in my playlist, but I refuse to change Eurythmics to Annie Lennox._
