Tomorrow, Ned and I leave on our cross Canada road trip. Here are our planned stops.

Ottawa, Sault Saint Marie, Dryden, Regina and Calgary

I had to get the car fixed before we leave .. our plan was to leave today, but the car took longer than I had anticipated. It needed: a new head gasket, head needed to be planed, valve job and oil change, total cost .. alot. We're good to go, runs like a new car.

I bought a 75W power inverter for the cigarette plug in the car so we can use the laptop or iPod continuously for tunes, which we'll need alot of.
