Woohoo! First snow storm.. I hope. Forecast calls for 20-30 cms, and I'm off, so I'll probally go out and have a stroll in the snow. I haven't been up to much these days, nothing different. Went to see Jimmy Swift Band and Grand Theft Bus with Al on Saturday, I think I went out Wednesday and Thursday too. Not sure. I bought Sopranos season 3, Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring Special Edition and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, only thing left to watch is Sopranos.




Lady I just feel like
I won't catch you
out of my mind
I feel love for the first time
and I know that is true
I can turn by the look in your eyes




I'm going to start work on a back ground for my site, be back when I'm done.
