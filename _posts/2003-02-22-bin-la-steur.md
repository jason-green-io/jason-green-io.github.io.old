I posted that last entry before knowing my good friend [Nic][1] actually started a blog back in December.. and I didn't even notice! What friend I am, geez. It's hosted on blogger (we won't hold that against him :) We went out to Ivory's then Nav, met up with Jack and Pat, good times! Today I get to see a new 12" G4 PowerBook.. droooool...
