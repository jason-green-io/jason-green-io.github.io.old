I'm ready to go. I had, yet another, dream last night. I don't usually remember my dreams, but I've been remembering them for the past 3 days now. I'm actually wondering if it's a sign of some sort. One more and I'll have to do something about it. (nothing negative, more like preventative) I had problems with GeoCities last night, it wouldn't save the changes, well, it did. Freaky typos, missing times and all. So I fixed it 2 minutes ago. The bus leaves the mall at 9:30, but my Dad said he'd drive me to college, so I can stay here for awile longer. Al updated [Wonderflur][1] last night.. or this morning I should say. Good work. He's also got a message board up, so go see his site and leve something behind, like a message or something, not banana peels or recycled egg cartons.

I was looking for picture of my bass, and I found this, close enough, you get the general idea.
