Finally, we're switching to the new schedule. I'll have somewhat regular work hours and weekends off. To start off I'll have the Mon-Fri 08:30-17:00 shift for 2 weeks .. then I go to the Tue-Sat 00:00-08:30 shift for 2 weeks then I do the Sun-Thu 08:00-04:30 shift for 2 weeks. And then... who knows.
