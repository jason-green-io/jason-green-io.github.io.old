Lab, lab, lab. It's the lacation I'm presently able to be found at. I have an entry on my Palm, but you'll only see it later on.. weird. It'll be like I'm going in the past. I think I'll put Palm entries in _Italic_ so as to give the user (you) an idea that it may not have been inserted chronologically. Now that I have rechargeables... well.. if I go on I'd be repeating myself.. read up later on today. .. or.. forget this sentence if there's something on top.. actually.. you would have read it alr... oh NEVERMIND!
