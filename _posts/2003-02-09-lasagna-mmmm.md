I made lasagna today.. It's baking right now, I can hear the cheese sizzling and the smell of tomato sauce, cheese, ground beef and spices and cheese is filling my abode, smells wonderful, it's loaded with cheese.. droooool.. I can't wait to slam a big chunk on my plate and dig in.





40 minutes pass





ahhhhhh... that was gooooood
