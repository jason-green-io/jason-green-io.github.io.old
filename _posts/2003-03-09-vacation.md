Starting the morning of the 11th, I'm on vacation.. til April. I've never taken a vacation before, should be interesting. I'll be going to college, so it's not 100% vacation.. but compared to work, college is going to be peanuts.





Still laptopless. Hoping to get some news today.





Got my m515 back.





Finished watching [Cosmos][1] (btw, I bought Cosmos) .. it's the closest thing *I* can call a bible. I'll be buying and reading ALL of Carl Sagan's books. To give you an idea.. or a glimps of why I love Carl Sagan.. here's a quote.. not from Cosmos mind you. "A celibate clergy is an especially good idea, because it tends to suppress any hereditary propensity toward fanaticism."
