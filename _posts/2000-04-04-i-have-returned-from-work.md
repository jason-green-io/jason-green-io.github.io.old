I have returned from work. For those of you in the Moncton NB reigon, you will notice something different when seeing a movie at Crystal Palace Cinemas. The ushers over there now have to make announcements in front of presentations to promote our new "Stash your Trash" campaign. It doesn't work. Poor them. "What we do is what you just can't do." Here's a cool picture.

That's the Cigar Galaxy in Ursa Major, the red gas is hydrogen expulsed from a super stellar wind. I love it.
