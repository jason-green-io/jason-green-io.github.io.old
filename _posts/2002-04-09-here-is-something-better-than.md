Here is something better than what I posted yesterday. I got a satellite dish! It was cool setting it up, did it all by myself.. with the help of the manual and my neighbor's tools. I'm off for the next 2 days, woohoo! If you're reading this, go in the feedback section now and post something, please.. I hate seeing it empty. If you don't want to do it, then done, that's fine.. I still don't have any suggestions for a new name, and I'm not going to decide. Give me a name, please. I sound like that Oxy Clean guy, trying to sell tubs of white paste. APPROX. VOLUME, that's what I'm seeing now, it's on my Nalgene bottle.
