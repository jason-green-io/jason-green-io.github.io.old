I'm still iBookless, brought it in last morning. So I watched half of the new Animatrix.. then my iBook froze.. I'll have to watch it somewhere else or wait.





I purchased an Afterburner kit for my GameBoy Advance. It adds a backlight, which doesn't come standard on a GameBoy Advance. So.. that means i can play Tetris in the dark, yes!!!





Weekend off, I have 7.5 hours left, w00t. Nic's got something planned for Friday, not quite sure what yet, but I'm in!
