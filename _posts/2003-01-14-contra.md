I played Contra: Shattered Soldier 12 hours straight this morning. I dreamt of Contra today, and I plan on playing more tonight.





I redesigned the site again, making the blog.. THE site. I'll figure out a way to get the galleries back, but I'm not rushed. Now I need to take a shower, eat and play Contra. Gonna need some munchies and more pop. I also need a new 30W bulb for one of my lamps. Can't wait to get paid, I have a list of stuff I'm going to buy for my kitchen, so I can start cooking. (keep the "yeah right" commentaries to yourselves, in fact, I'm going disable comments on this one, ha!





I'm going to take a picture now, of something random and put it up.
