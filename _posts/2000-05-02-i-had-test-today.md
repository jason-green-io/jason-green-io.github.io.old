I had a test today. I think I passed it. I think I'm going to listen to Zéro ° Celcius, something I havent listened to in several years. Carpe Diem. I`m so glad I put Yoda on top of my ADSL modem. I have a paper cut on my middle finger, I don`t know where it came from. Oh, I remember this song. La Ballade du Capitain Gallager, Remi Arsenault sang it a one of my high school's Boite à Chansons. Shanghai Noon looks like it's going to be funny.
