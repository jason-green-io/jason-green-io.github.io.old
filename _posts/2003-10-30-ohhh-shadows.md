Safari 1.1 (that's a browser in OS X, 10.3 actually) supports drop shadows thru CSS2. Very cool stuff, if you visit my site with Safari 1.1, you'll notice nice shadows, w00t. For people who don't have CSS2 browsers (poor Windows people and older versions of Safari or Mozilla.. or whatever else you use) tough!
