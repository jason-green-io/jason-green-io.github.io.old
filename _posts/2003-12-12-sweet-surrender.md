Hello, my first post [Picker][1] post. If you live under a rock, I did something with that 6100 Nic gave me, it's now a message board. Feel free to sign up and join in the kookiness. I'm listening to Sarah McLachlan (I always have to look up her last name on google for the correct spelling, very sad). I'm feeling a little nostalgic, even melancholic these days. I digress for now, but I'm going to have to do something about that.

Snow, yes, we've had alot of snow. 70cms people say. I refer you to [this][2] post. Scroll down, that's my car.

Well it's getting early, time for bed. S'ouaira.
