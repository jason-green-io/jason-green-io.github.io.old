Yup, that'll do for now.. There's still stuff I have to fix, like the Ma Brain logo, need to get tht transparent. There's also problems on the feedback page.. I'd like the author of that script to have an option to not put a bgcolor in the tds .. until then I'm going to modify his code.



Drove downtown in the rain nine-thirty on a Tuesday night,
just to check out the late-night record shop.
Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, call it insane,
but when I'm surrounded I just can't stop.



Haha stupid me, there is an option!
