Just paid my eedingspay icketay, walked back.. got to the mall and met Gisele, she gave me a ride home! Woohoo!! I'm getting a throat ache, a sign of things to come. Dammit! My parental units aren't home. I saw them go by on Main St. .. but they're not here.. I bet they're eating out somewhere. Dammit! I'm hungry, didn't eat today, had to finish a mid term report I wasn't going to hand in. Mmm.. flat Sprite.. AHH GROSSS!!! not good anymore.
