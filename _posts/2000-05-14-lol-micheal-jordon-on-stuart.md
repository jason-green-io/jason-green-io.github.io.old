Oh.. the Paul McCartney interview.. very funny! lol! I'm thirsty.. hmm what could I drink: water, milk, juice, pop, water, milk, pop, water, milk, pop, juice, pop, water, milk...

"What's my bag? It's milk, baby, yeah! The calcium in lowfat or fat free milk helps to prevent osteoporosis and keep my bones strong. So I can keep my mojo working overtime. Oh, behave."

I pick milk baby!
